He was more athletic, had more friends, got more girls. And things were going great for him. He was managing a pizza place. He had two kids, my nephews. But after he lost his job he started dealing drugs. He didn’t last two months in the streets. Benjamin thought the world was like our family; he was too trusting of people. And Detroit is a very dangerous place to be trusting of people. The Detroit Police Department did nothing: no leads, no investigation. It’s like he wasn’t even human. You can just murder people in that city. After his death I forgot about school. I dropped my classes, started drinking more, partying more. There was a lot of sex, a lot of meaningless sex. Nothing seemed to matter. It was dark. I was so angry at God, because how could he let that happen? But it’s been four years now. And looking back—if he hadn’t been killed, so many other things don’t happen. I’d have never left Detroit. Benjamin was the one who always told me: ‘You’re special. You don’t have to stay here.’ But if he hadn’t been killed, I’d have never come to New York. And if I don’t come to New York, I don’t meet my best friend, which is my wife. Our wedding brought my whole family together for the first time since Benjamin’s death. It was love and joy again. My mom walking me down the aisle, after losing her son. It just meant the world to her. And if I hadn’t met my wife, we wouldn’t have a son on the way. We’re naming him Benjamin.”","Photo by Humans of New York on August 27, 2024.

This is an absolute  outrage! Footage has just been leaked showing the cruelty these puppies are being subjected to, being forced to wear inhalation masks!! Testing on animals is widely documented to be outdated and unrealiable and most of all torture! This is not science !! Please take action. These puppies and dogs need us!

"Photo by Humans of New York on July 23, 2024. May be an image of one or more people, newspaper, book and street.","“It’s a miracle I’m even here. My father went through World War II: the Normandy Invasion, Omaha Beach. So for him to survive all that, and live long enough to become my father—it’s a miraculous thing. He died before I was eight years old. But it was enough time to experience him deeply. I was very loved, very welcomed, very cared for: my parents were thrilled I was their child. When I was younger I traveled quite a bit. Not every place, but a lot of places: Greece, Turkey, Alaska. And this wasn’t just going on tours. It was real, vagabond stuff: no reservations, no plans. Just deeply experiencing another culture and another place. I’ve gotten to do every kind of work, from agricultural labor to factory work. For twenty years I was a social worker with seniors. But I can’t even call that a job, it was a service. I got to take care of people: bring them meals, help with housekeeping. It was an absolute calling. I was a workaholic. And now that I’m retired— I’m a play-aholic. There’s nonstop free music in New York. I come to this park to listen to jazz piano. I go to Juilliard to listen to student recitals. There’s going to be a Dixieland ragtime ensemble near Macy’s. I mean, it’s endless. I’m just grateful for good health to enjoy it all. So many people wake up in pain. But I have my health, and I have a home. I mean, it’s not a home. But I have a place. A safe place to rent. It’s just been a blessed, beautiful life. The perfect life for me. I found it very, very rich. Very deep. And I think all of it was a blessing. All of it, miracles and blessings.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1451","720","1080","https://instagram.fsac1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/452517933_444906868369405_3102264933263194379_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fsac1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=XpuCojQ3_6oQ7kNvgER9WLp&_nc_gid=47d75815ea7349668d5985c4c4d1a15e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBCUg2f9wWVKDmbbmRXlnluevkOuX6PBDZRzsCl4ML5wQ&oe=6716E6CC&_nc_sid=10d13b","“It was a service.” What a beautiful, well-lived life full of taking care of others.

"Photo by Humans of New York on July 28, 2024. May be an image of book.","“He was a mentor. The leader of a huge religious organization: intelligent, charismatic. Everyone respected him. I was a teenage girl. My father traveled a lot. I never had any boyfriends. I wanted affection. And for him to give me attention, it was like—I wanted that. I did want it. I wanted him to look at me. I would dress for him. It makes me sick to think about now, but I would choose my clothes solely to make him look at me. I wanted him to say that I was pretty. I wanted his attention. And because I wanted it at first, you know—I felt like I gave myself to this person willingly. That’s why I didn’t report it for so many years. Because I felt like I was tempting him. He waited until I turned eighteen. And every time he abused me, he encouraged me to share the responsibility. He used the word ‘we.’ Always ‘we.’ He’d say: ‘We’re not supposed to be doing this. You’re making me do this. I don’t want to, but you’re making me do this.’ Every time it was over, he’d say: ‘Now go to church and confess. Confess to tempting an older man.’ I sued him last year, thanks to the Adult Survivors Act. I expected him to fight it tooth and nail; deny everything. But a couple days ago he sent a statement to my lawyer, basically apologizing for everything. When I got the letter, I thought of the child me. All I did in my mind was hug that child. It’s like: you can forgive yourself now. There was never any ‘we.’ He knew you didn’t have a father figure. He knew how you’d respond to the attention. He knew how you’d respond to the guilt, and the shame. He knew everything. It may have felt like you were choosing, but you weren’t. You were chosen.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"525","720","1080","https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/453084933_1147683062972381_2860477099145048355_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=SErPFmb8QhMQ7kNvgHEyQvX&_nc_gid=85b4cfa0551048d7b1e007162576f050&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAtwrBltnFMdFhRybYWihe1jGI7hQepOXw73RP_cQPjLQ&oe=6716C890&_nc_sid=10d13b","Powerful is an understatement.

I think she just finds the whitest religion she can possibly believe in. It’s like: alright Carol, do your thing. I’m here to support you. Then I have an edgelord older brother, who’s all: ‘I’m a Satanist.’ OK, Andrew. Let’s calm down. My dad is more of a Mexican Catholic Guy. He just copes. He’s really banking on the whole last rites thing, so he’s kinda sorted. Honestly, I wish I was religious. At least they have something. Because for me it’s like: ‘Oh shit, there’s nothing next.’ And that doesn’t sound nice. But ultimately life is just a series of chemical reactions, which is a depressing way of thinking about it. But I mean, I’m pretty sure that’s what’s happening here. Even these thoughts—they’re just a series of chemical reactions, and one day the reactions end, and you can’t think anymore. I don’t even want to think about it. My therapist was like: ‘You should really stop thinking about it.’ I’ve actually chilled out a lot from when I was at my worst. Here’s something I use to comfort myself: ultimately my body is going to decay and I’ll get recycled back into the earth, right? And maybe a mushroom will spring up from my body. That’s a new form of something-or-other. And when the Earth finally comes to an end— my molecules will still be there, in some form. Just floating through the universe, forever. So that’s nice, I guess. That’s a comforting thought.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2213","720","1080","https://instagram.fsjo10-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/454462848_1302717180705815_2749989388121078156_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fsjo10-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=YSmV_yFdX8gQ7kNvgFGiGv-&_nc_gid=19524afd67e44c2e826b070e4aebd435&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA_IXQXgp1a_g9OCZWdO17jhN0s-UwMFoSfiovi4Izo_A&oe=6716EA5B&_nc_sid=10d13b","He would probably enjoy reading the book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible.

For my Autistic son especially; because he’s the one that needs me the most. I work full time. And as soon as my work schedule stops, my mom schedule starts. I’m on the way to pick them up right now. I know the bond is there. Oh my God; they’re so attached to me. But I feel like they only get to see the strict mom, the military mom. The school is always asking us to do more academic things with them. So it’s a lot of: let’s do homework, let’s read books. Then after that it’s: we have to eat, we have to take a shower, we have to go to bed. And let’s do it fast. Because you need to get to sleep. You need your rest, because we have so much to do tomorrow. I feel like what I’m missing most, at this moment, is fun. There’s no time for fun. I don’t want them to only see me as a mother. I want them to see me as a friend, a best friend. Someone who will do crazy stuff with them. I heard that it might rain today.

"Photo by Humans of New York on July 08, 2024. Nenhuma descrição de foto disponível..","“Nobody taught me. There were so many of us in the house, and even my Nanna didn’t know how to read. So I never learned to read. I was so bad at school that I acted like a clown just to avoid everything; then I got caught running around here with a pistol when I was thirteen. They sent me to Tryon Juvenile Detention Center, and that’s where I met Ms. Lakewood. She taught the computer class. Heavy-set Italian lady, about 4’ 10”. But attitude, huge. Aura, big. She was like the grandmother in a mob movie. You know how you’ve got all the bosses, but when the grandmother comes in—everyone shuts up? She was like that. But she was loving too. She had pictures on the wall of all her favorite students; she called them her babies. She even had a picture of Mike Tyson up there. He was one of her babies. One day we had this contest, on the computer. The winner got $50. And I was looking at the screen and getting so angry. I’m crying, because I couldn’t read. And that’s when this Spanish kid called me Forrest Gump. He had the whole class laughing at me. Miss Lakewood was like: ‘What’s going on?’ She came over to me and said: ‘Fix your face. Fix your fucking face, I don’t want to see another tear.’ Then she said: ‘Tomorrow, you better get ready.’ She started working with me for an hour-and-a-half, every night. She started me on Lion King. It was a preschool book, so I didn’t want to do it. But she made me. Every night she made me keep reading until I was able to read on my grade level. I started getting report cards with nothing less than 85. I was sending them home; my mom was getting hyped. I got my GED. I started reading so much. Today I can finish a five-hundred-page book in two days. If I smoke a blunt first, I swear to God I can picture the whole book like it’s a movie. Miss Lakewood passed away when I was eighteen. I heard about it while I was in prison. Some new guys came in; they’d been in Tryon too. They heard me talking about her and that’s when one of them told me. But he said: ‘Yo. I’m pretty sure she had your picture on the wall.’”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2160","720","1080","https://instagram.fcgr8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/450223846_1487870355147169_8320998429215394561_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fcgr8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=QGdu2XUZhH0Q7kNvgGelaIX&_nc_gid=901c7b4af5e348ada66ea716e0e3648e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDAD72l9i7f2JcbG7kf5ZYIcIi7X6ZwTZY63TlLXckwyA&oe=6716BD2A&_nc_sid=10d13b","@humansofny what year was that?

"Photo by Humans of New York on July 17, 2024.","“It’s going on seven years now. I was functioning until I lost my apartment, then my job. I was living with this one couple for a while but they kicked me out. But I try not to think about how long it’s been. I’ve read books about heroin addicts who changed their lives around twenty-six, so you know. I’m still young. I just want to get back to my life. I’m tired of waking up and needing it to not feel sick. I’m tired of being homeless. I want to start talking to my family again; that’s the biggest, I think. The not speaking to my parents. I missed my mom’s birthday. And my sister’s birthday; just two days ago. I really am blessed with a good family. I mean, my parents were strict; but I can’t blame that anymore. I’ve been trying to figure out the source of it. I think part of me just wanted to try everything. You know: what’s it like? But I think there was another part of me that wanted the attention, I guess. Something I could do so that people would like, ask me: are you ok? Some way to share the pain.

"Photo by Humans of New York on June 19, 2024.","“I was seventeen. Only child, not a lot of friends. But I had a plan. I was going to become an actress, get a role on All My Children, meet my husband on set— and when that was all over—I’d host a talk show. Kelly Ripa did it; I could do it too. Back then it seemed like every woman on television had gotten their start as beauty queen. So my senior year I decided to enter my school’s Homecoming Queen competition. It was organized like a Ms. America pageant. But this was a rough high school, only one other girl signed up— so I had a good shot. My whole family got behind me. My mom was a seamstress. We noticed that in most pageants we watched, the winner wore a white dress. So she sewed me a white dress that I picked out of Seventeen Magazine. First came the interview portion, and that’s when the trouble started. The judges asked me about the Anita Hill testimony; I wasn’t ready for that. I was ready for world peace. They were supposed to ask me about my goals, so I could say world peace. But that didn’t happen. The talent portion was later that night at the homecoming dance. The whole school was there. I chose a Sheena Easton song; poor choice. Not the right crowd for that. The other girl chose ‘I Feel Good’ by Stephanie Mills, and she had the whole crowd singing along. That’s when I knew it was over. But then, a miracle. The guidance counselor quieted everyone down, and announced the winner: it was me. Me! It was my Kelly Kapowski moment. Everyone was cheering, the other girl congratulated me. But it only lasted five seconds, because the guidance counselor said: ‘Wait a second, I’m sorry. Joanna is the runner-up.’ It was the worst moment of my life. In fact, the only thing that got me through COVID was knowing that it could not possibly, possibly be worse than that moment. And here’s a twist for you. Remember that guidance counselor? Several years later I ended up acting alongside his son in a play at Queens College. In one scene I pulled a gun on him, and the director was like: ‘We need more anger. Think about something that makes you angry.’ I was like: ‘Well, that’s easy. His father ruined my senior year. And quite possibly, my entire life.”","Photo by Humans of New York on June 19, 2024.","","0","720","1080","https://instagram.fanu1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/448782272_1215692662934421_2627348799197852071_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fanu1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=vwqtfrcVuegQ7kNvgGNDXWp&_nc_gid=60c23a79f47c441182b5396976baaf0c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCpipzcflY35ioLgq-Xyzpc0emBePNPOhSQXMwXB73knQ&oe=6716D59A&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3394031400909436287",,,"C8aBZOnunV_",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/C8aBZOnunV_/","Photo by Humans of New York on June 19, 2024.","","0","720","1080","https://instagram.fanu1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/448609423_488187726910329_1724661921368369938_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fanu1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=60-UwSQg9pcQ7kNvgFsuIAy&_nc_gid=60c23a79f47c441182b5396976baaf0c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDj7gYNHKCzwiq57n9mhrxDSqS2ktAr1YzIWjkN76oeqw&oe=6716D9F0&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3394031400909299407",,,"C8aBZOnuF7P",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/C8aBZOnuF7P/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"844","720","1080","https://instagram.fanu1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/448782272_1215692662934421_2627348799197852071_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fanu1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=vwqtfrcVuegQ7kNvgGNDXWp&_nc_gid=60c23a79f47c441182b5396976baaf0c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCpipzcflY35ioLgq-Xyzpc0emBePNPOhSQXMwXB73knQ&oe=6716D59A&_nc_sid=10d13b","Така чудова історія👏🏻","3394031405363824692","https://instagram.fanu1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/448782272_1215692662934421_2627348799197852071_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fanu1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=vwqtfrcVuegQ7kNvgGNDXWp&_nc_gid=60c23a79f47c441182b5396976baaf0c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCpipzcflY35ioLgq-Xyzpc0emBePNPOhSQXMwXB73knQ&oe=6716D59A&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://instagram.fanu1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/448609423_488187726910329_1724661921368369938_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fanu1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=60-UwSQg9pcQ7kNvgFsuIAy&_nc_gid=60c23a79f47c441182b5396976baaf0c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDj7gYNHKCzwiq57n9mhrxDSqS2ktAr1YzIWjkN76oeqw&oe=6716D9F0&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18019202492431797","0","https://instagram.fanu1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/458610575_455654737436152_281159233435772323_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fanu1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=-lNUFZ43NsAQ7kNvgE5I0E3&_nc_gid=60c23a79f47c441182b5396976baaf0c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBuZeXH8Xgg0VzYe4rCo669GFIEweJQMg0kCTSX_LWBqA&oe=6716EE92&_nc_sid=10d13b","thelma._.xo",,,,,,,,"0","Така чудова історія👏🏻","2024-09-07T13:44:33.000Z","17901551409013009","0","https://instagram.fanu1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/463130892_898136755594792_6386272996908730497_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fanu1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=RCs7FwVOF48Q7kNvgEnJdDN&_nc_gid=60c23a79f47c441182b5396976baaf0c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCADnm9JkSVdA_4B9LTKB3x7SErF_047mrCXcLkV4zOkw&oe=6716E378&_nc_sid=10d13b","marichelleb",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","😂😂❤️❤️❤️","2024-08-09T00:35:14.000Z","18042681878054263","0","https://instagram.fanu1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/458082596_9849136131776597_6439744130023022529_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fanu1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=KxMmCHUul3IQ7kNvgG1SPq8&_nc_gid=60c23a79f47c441182b5396976baaf0c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDEmRuQpIegdS-vJAVSChUaM8GVIh3llcxYETYEF92TuA&oe=6716B8BD&_nc_sid=10d13b","regina7dem",,,,,,,,"0","@joneflick lol really 🙃","2024-09-24T17:25:15.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"102826",,,,,,,,,,"Humans of New York","242598499","humansofny",,"C8aBZSxOwg0","2024-06-19T18:01:34.000Z","Sidecar","https://www.instagram.com/p/C8aBZSxOwg0/",,,,
"Photo by Humans of New York on June 18, 2024.","“People see it as a fake sport. Whenever you tell someone you play Ultimate, it’s like: oh, is that where you throw a frisbee in a basket? Or is that the one where you throw it to a dog? Whenever I’m talking to someone about it, I just hope they’ll ask me enough questions so that I can talk about UNC Ultimate. That was probably the most special experience I’m ever going to have in my whole life. I was on the team for five years, then I came back and coached. My freshman year we were really, really bad. But at the moment UNC Chapel Hill is triple back-to-back-to-back national champions. And I got to be part of that trajectory. But even though the team kept getting better and better, I kinda stayed at the same level. I never became the elite player that I wanted to be. I have a lot of ‘stick-to-it-ive-ness.’ I’m capable of working really, really hard. And part of me always believed that would be enough, which is the part that burned me out. Because after working so hard, for so long, I reached a plateau. It was physical stuff. I’m just not quick enough. When I play defense I can’t keep up with the fastest offensive handlers. They’re going to score, and that’s a problem. I ended up getting cut from the elite women’s club team I was on. I switched over to mixed, but ended up tearing my ACL a couple years ago. It’s been my life for ten years, but now I’m at a place where I don’t know if I’m ever going to play again. I just don’t know if my body can handle it. I don’t want to have another, like massive orthopedic surgery. And frisbee takes up so much bandwidth; there’s so many other things I want to explore. The list is infinitely long. I’m asking myself: could I be happy playing on a mid-level team where the commitment wouldn’t be quite as high? Or will I only feel satisfied if I’m exceptional? That’s an unhealthy connection I have in my head, I think. That love is something you need to earn. And being exceptional will make me worthy of having connections with people. It would be great to become a version of myself where I no longer feel that way. And maybe we’ll get there someday. We’re working on it.

I’m a lot more mature than most fourteen-year-olds; I already have a job and everything. But she’ll shut me down just to get at me. And there’s nothing I can do because she’s my Mom. She’s always on top of me: be careful with this, be careful with that. Won’t let me go to my friend’s houses if they’re a little further than our neighborhood. And we’re both stubborn, so if I try to argue it goes back and forth. She doesn’t want to see her kid be right. She gives me no choice but to be loud and extreme just to get my point across. But look, I get it. She’s got this Google folder on her phone with like 1400 photos of me when I was younger. It goes all the way back to my first day of school. The other day I went into the kitchen to get a drink, and I caught her scrolling through the pictures, and she’s crying. I was like damn. So look— I get it.

"Photo by Humans of New York on January 05, 2024.","“Just the other day a video popped up on Facebook. It was only five years ago. We were in the park. I was pushing her on the bike, letting go. We used to have so much fun together. We’d always get ice cream. She’s a strawberry girl. I’m a vanilla guy. Chipwich, actually. I’m a Chipwich guy. She’d give me a hug afterward, tell me I was the best dad ever. We were such good friends. But now it feels like we’re so far apart. She doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. Even when she’s upset, she’ll ignore me and go to her room. It’s like: C’mon. I was fifteen too. I know what it’s like. But she’ll come back, I know that. They always come back. But it does feels like you’re getting your heart ripped out a little bit.  But look, I get it. She’s figuring out life. You have to back off. You have to give them space. Cause if you charge after them and get all aggressive about it, you might push them away forever. But they always come back, right? One day she’s gonna realize that I’m not the enemy and I’m really her dad, her friend. I still get a flicker of it, every once in awhile. We had a really surreal moment last year. Her birthday is March 17th. She’s a St. Paddy’s Day birthday. We always take her to a Spanish restaurant on Long Island, but this time we did something special. Her uncle used to be a bodyguard for Taylor Swift, and we still know some people at the company. So they got us tickets to her concert. Fifth row seats. I mean, don’t get me wrong. We paid for them-- but fifth row center. She was crying. I got a big hug. A big kiss. A ‘Thank you, Dad.’ It wasn’t ‘You’re the best dad ever.’ But it was a really big: ‘Thank you, Dad.’”","Photo by Humans of New York on January 05, 2024.","","0","719","1080","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/416618606_191976500663721_3605867973121899952_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=4MFb9qMF3zAQ7kNvgFweW2j&_nc_gid=584b152bd94c401a81af52dccee2b5c9&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDyX5SBBBuSGBsKh9xcG4YOUlrPlwv7ZY_1jI3WSnXQ8A&oe=6716C06D&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3273691253491684253",,,"C1ufNmsrNOd",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/C1ufNmsrNOd/","Photo by Humans of New York on January 05, 2024.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/416410207_1120543422657905_8755566184569345939_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=RlOfxLQa-4MQ7kNvgExiEeY&_nc_gid=584b152bd94c401a81af52dccee2b5c9&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDslK68z7EaMlUawANXX9bdjSmU1SbX2iKAMT8inXbBeA&oe=6716B942&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3273691253483395505",,,"C1ufNmsLlmx",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/C1ufNmsLlmx/",,,,"Photo by Humans of New York on January 05, 2024.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/416672493_342186255294649_1898842355219463404_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=5iUzxYOzzMwQ7kNvgFF37ES&_nc_gid=584b152bd94c401a81af52dccee2b5c9&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBlGitmxf4xcYZsE5EuDt0zIxtyZhkHHMAIewH78BLHcA&oe=6716ED70&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3273691253466595764",,,"C1ufNmrLgG0",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/C1ufNmrLgG0/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1701","719","1080","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/416618606_191976500663721_3605867973121899952_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=4MFb9qMF3zAQ7kNvgFweW2j&_nc_gid=584b152bd94c401a81af52dccee2b5c9&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDyX5SBBBuSGBsKh9xcG4YOUlrPlwv7ZY_1jI3WSnXQ8A&oe=6716C06D&_nc_sid=10d13b","She'll be back fully.

"Photo by Humans of New York on January 12, 2024.","“Occasionally I’ll have a beer after work and break out the sketchbook. But I had wanted to be this great painter. I wanted to do these grand things: big, huge oil paintings. But those days of painting all the time were such a roller coaster. There were these periods of extreme depression, followed by manic states of trying to put myself out there. I couldn’t do it anymore. I mainly felt sorry for my dad. I know it was rough for him. My mom hadn’t wanted me to go to art school. She wanted me to do something more practical, but my dad said: ‘No. This is what he wants to do, and I want to support his dream.’ And then I abandoned it. That was the first time I had to deal with real failure. A lot of times when you’re an artist—it’s your job, it’s your lifestyle, it’s your entire fucking identity. It wasn’t like I failed to do a thing. It was like: I failed to be something, you know? It was a failure to live up to what I thought was my destiny. But then on the other side of that-- there was this figuring out that there was nothing wrong with me the entire time. I didn’t need to be something else to have meaningful friendships, or a good relationship. I didn’t need to be something else to be loved and cared about. After work tonight I’m going to meet up with a person who’s in love with me, and I can’t wait. And that person met me long after I gave up on being a full-time artist. They met me when I wasn’t even a chef yet. I was a piss-poor, part-time line cook. But even then-- they decided I was worth it. So you know, there’s something there. There’s something there that’s enough.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1009","720","1080","https://instagram.fmci1-4.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/418647879_1064487471551448_8764353666857201825_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fmci1-4.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=sz02KgHgyPgQ7kNvgEGGkTp&_nc_gid=f323e1126d59473eb370ba63e42422db&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB3OWTp7lh2IEzhJoPGbAkddPRdeWPkpoEsDDci7cf1fA&oe=6716E5E9&_nc_sid=10d13b","This art school drop out needed to hear this.

I said: ‘I gotta catch up with that girl,’ and I never did let her slip. There was a big song on the radio back then, about gettin’ married. Everybody was singing it, something about: ‘When we get married, we gonna have a celebration.’ You keep hearing it every day, and you wanna try it too. Never thought it would last this long. It’s been a good ride though. Everybody has a little bump here and there. We had our arguments, and I ain’t never did win one. Ain’t no man ever gonna win when it comes down to arguing with your wife. You could be married for a hundred years, she’s gonna have the last word. So no need to get your mouth all rolled up. Don’t stand there arguing and cursing. Just listen, laugh, and let it go. Kiss her on the cheek and say: ‘you the winner.’ After that, everything will be beautiful.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1239","720","1080","https://instagram.fssa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/434108784_941390584159034_1011529965313697080_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fssa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=D0ttVGPNquUQ7kNvgFqL40u&_nc_gid=2277314725834afeb677837993315569&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAkWZaavd1wUuZAgXHBGuCucNwS8bGyo4wPRegmDdWQ2g&oe=6716E90C&_nc_sid=10d13b","❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️","3327271923891462771",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17900583369026604","0","https://instagram.fssa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/457145853_1025259712194336_7694168653927090974_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fssa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=iuBEpz3sjpsQ7kNvgGg12kR&_nc_gid=2277314725834afeb677837993315569&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDG6_Q-4VZ55WBYJQlxRvX6bz69YfsGYkC8j9di1mLdSg&oe=6716ED0D&_nc_sid=10d13b","vintageglass4me",,,,,,,,"0","❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️","2024-09-06T12:54:44.000Z","18451328383000657","0","https://instagram.fssa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/279076685_5063162527092752_8482485419478860988_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fssa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=I21lp94UapoQ7kNvgGh6-4R&_nc_gid=2277314725834afeb677837993315569&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBh4ox_gShjXjoDLPkdP31Mt4aMwxc4urw43aznpsVsYQ&oe=6716C34F&_nc_sid=10d13b","geecheemeat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","😍😍😍","2024-08-27T20:13:10.000Z","18099231715431950","0","https://instagram.fssa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/447812056_295083627015919_1139285743096921073_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fssa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=HzRA7eQnC30Q7kNvgE5FAZi&_nc_gid=2277314725834afeb677837993315569&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCl60gMo0i9Q8XVZcif5dQ5NvZtRtO48C8xkHTjV8cmBA&oe=6716C291&_nc_sid=10d13b","iammonisharenee",,,,,,,,"0","Yeah…cause granny look like she ain’t playing!!!🌝☺️🤣‼️🤞🏿","2024-08-27T19:50:39.000Z","18013415636310735","0","https://instagram.fssa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/456557969_1675066896611534_3154906656696927529_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fssa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=oM-rxtcbBo8Q7kNvgEQYD1l&_nc_gid=2277314725834afeb677837993315569&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDVT85scNHdwnzOm7jkhlw_CYAsPIODEpTPlEqXKegxiw&oe=6716E9D7&_nc_sid=10d13b","__c_lynn_t",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Yes, dear.","2024-08-26T14:47:22.000Z","18447961921029045","0","https://instagram.fssa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/457487561_1428382387855200_3255358070594165304_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fssa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=KPeEhRaA9x0Q7kNvgEw4DYL&_nc_gid=2277314725834afeb677837993315569&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCUOCjxjMa7qcENJY--fqpcHPenXT1v-NXGrke9sgr-dg&oe=6716D4ED&_nc_sid=10d13b","missbri0889","0","❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️","2024-08-08T17:36:53.000Z","17922665978933474","0","https://instagram.fssa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/272001528_142579071495703_6055200255095099685_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fssa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=63X3LYPwfywQ7kNvgHO8e42&_nc_gid=2277314725834afeb677837993315569&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCKAZILF0hAs_sNUNPClXiO7O4WcBfG837m0QNx4JA4Bg&oe=6716E5F5&_nc_sid=10d13b","rosalie1228",,,,,,,,"0","This got me.

"Photo by Humans of New York on January 10, 2024.","“My first end-of-life patient was a 97-year-old man. He had a much younger girlfriend; she was seventy-four. But they loved each other so much. Back when their spouses were still alive, the four of them had been great friends. They would double date together. And when their spouses passed away—the two of them became a thing. Every day she would come over for lunch. I’d always cook a little meal for them. I’d prepare the table; I’d lay out my little candles and my little flowers. As soon as she arrived I’d put on music and dim the lights, then I’d leave the room and go wait in the bedroom. They would cuddle and snuggle. And the beauty of it was—even though he couldn’t control his fluids at that point, she never minded the smell. Her love for him was so great that they would still kiss and all that good stuff. When the doctors said that it was time for him to go to hospice, he said he didn’t want to go. He told them that he wanted to come back home and die with me. I was with him in the end. My patients never die alone. Never, ever. One week after his passing I was hired by his girlfriend’s family. She had terminal Alzheimer’s, and I ended up staying with her for seven years. I fell in love with her. We were family, just family. She used to be a tap dancer. We’d sing together. And if she didn’t feel like singing, I’d sing. Even near the end, she always knew when something was wrong with me. When I wasn’t being the Gabby that she knew-- she would always know. When the doctors said it was time for her to go to hospice, her children said: ‘We want her to die with Gabby.’ In the final days she wouldn’t eat, she’d lock her jaw. But she would always eat for me. One night I could see the fright in her eyes, and I knew it was time. My patients never die alone. Never, ever. So I climbed under the covers with her. And she passed away in my arms.”","Photo by Humans of New York on January 10, 2024.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/418406870_899193171759401_4146176295789945465_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=f5Fl1W0PoBIQ7kNvgFErclp&_nc_gid=4da332f5fe5140d29302076f3f37bbf0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA5MFmNUetx5kAqJS7E2EvM-T9zwHhgWEbXYHyHyRdsxg&oe=6716C072&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3277334508758612155",,,"C17bl8kr7i7",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/C17bl8kr7i7/","Photo by Humans of New York on January 10, 2024.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/418352908_210553372052666_1894051778592963673_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=oZa2UyAugbIQ7kNvgEaa07g&_nc_gid=4da332f5fe5140d29302076f3f37bbf0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBkwOqrI4Vd-wv2XeF1Mjncw21YL4we9eKXX1v8k3a9kQ&oe=6716B7AE&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3277334508758508111",,,"C17bl8kriJP",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/C17bl8kriJP/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"16056","720","1080","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/418406870_899193171759401_4146176295789945465_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=f5Fl1W0PoBIQ7kNvgFErclp&_nc_gid=4da332f5fe5140d29302076f3f37bbf0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA5MFmNUetx5kAqJS7E2EvM-T9zwHhgWEbXYHyHyRdsxg&oe=6716C072&_nc_sid=10d13b","Omggggggg what an amazing woman❤️","3277334513565249594","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/418406870_899193171759401_4146176295789945465_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=f5Fl1W0PoBIQ7kNvgFErclp&_nc_gid=4da332f5fe5140d29302076f3f37bbf0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA5MFmNUetx5kAqJS7E2EvM-T9zwHhgWEbXYHyHyRdsxg&oe=6716C072&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/418352908_210553372052666_1894051778592963673_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=oZa2UyAugbIQ7kNvgEaa07g&_nc_gid=4da332f5fe5140d29302076f3f37bbf0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBkwOqrI4Vd-wv2XeF1Mjncw21YL4we9eKXX1v8k3a9kQ&oe=6716B7AE&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17923891460974943","0","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/453246767_339045829282612_2667052163870516219_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=gT-ZP7-ybKYQ7kNvgEKn8Th&_nc_gid=4da332f5fe5140d29302076f3f37bbf0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDoT2Jp8ef3RovB31JewwqlBd_TGsurGf0qD0zA0MRHuA&oe=6716D703&_nc_sid=10d13b","itsyvette2024",,,,,,,,"0","Omggggggg what an amazing woman❤️","2024-10-15T08:22:07.000Z","18071937952589817","0","https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/456314149_1208174163668323_4094111869224579569_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=08ZtpvsY7ksQ7kNvgGlkU4W&_nc_gid=4da332f5fe5140d29302076f3f37bbf0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCDJZJC1F3xAVB8V1EAyYqxBFS4dnshRTICCB1Ibe8Gzg&oe=6716EB67&_nc_sid=10d13b","eternitysuniverse",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Wow very beautiful and inspiring, and puts it all again into perspective for me pursuing medicine.🤍","2024-10-06T02:28:46.000Z","17857810551257821","0","https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/458866531_1205587070689260_9127572339919490158_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=OhNMJnKTEjsQ7kNvgHDkWyC&_nc_gid=4da332f5fe5140d29302076f3f37bbf0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAi5k-T323Sxo_4Pz-6DT8EuYPLK7TbHg_VcSe1e5DXgQ&oe=6716C3B8&_nc_sid=10d13b","145andamsterdam",,,,,,,,"0","🥹🥹🥹","2024-09-30T12:19:56.000Z","18026322503127706","0","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/262799966_1288250424971261_79659283017045537_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=yTemJyBMD_YQ7kNvgHtYWSV&_nc_gid=4da332f5fe5140d29302076f3f37bbf0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAIsovMn-f_cKK3gBxr9FU5CsemXLYPJ0DUnkqHzmKw1A&oe=6716C690&_nc_sid=10d13b","sissyfish123",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","You are an Earth angel.

"Photo by Humans of New York on January 25, 2024.","“We’ve been dealing with invisibility. We started realizing we’re kind of fading. So many of our friends say that: that they’re becoming invisible. Everybody needs a welcome from somebody else so that they can feel useful. It’s a real source of energy. And when you realize you’re not getting that as much—what happens is you get scared. And you also say: maybe we could do something a little different. So at some point we came up with the idea of the cute older couple. We were hoping to find some younger friends. We’ve always been attracted to younger people. You know, young people struggle. So we like to support them and wish them well and give them a lot of approval. And young people need cute old couples. They love cute old couples. So we decided to play it up a little bit. That’s what it is: ‘play.’ It’s really play. Have you ever seen two dogs greet each other? One dog will drop down, and bam, suddenly they’re playing. I think that’s what we’re doing. We’re inviting a play response.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2239","719","1080","https://instagram.fdac41-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/422855493_1084162912895521_4748037953811895425_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fdac41-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=AkNP-8IbxYUQ7kNvgHIB5G0&_nc_gid=5c077a598f7b4a4fb17d063906e04183&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB315H4V49Vk9a7j1-3GuG7G2kC4FNVvjJ1SW-wORu2Tg&oe=6716DAB5&_nc_sid=10d13b","They posted  several  variations of this topic.

"Photo by Humans of New York on December 05, 2023.","“The question everybody wants to know is: why don’t the aliens contact us if they're really here? The answer is simple: because it would melt your psyche to contact beings from another dimension. Whether its ghosts or spirits or deceased relatives or past lives or future lives or aliens or Bigfoot or fairies, all of it will melt your psyche. Because you’ve been programmed by The Empire to believe those things don’t exist. Unless of course you’re an indigenous person raised on traditional shamanic ceremonies. I learned all this by talking to other humans on other earths in other universes, so I'm trying to not blow your mind right now. When you’re talking about other dimensions you have to use a lot of metaphors—so just imagine earth as North Korea. You’ve probably seen enough documentaries to know what's going on in North Korea. The North Korean people are completely mind locked and brainwashed, and they have a completely inaccurate understanding of the rest of the planet. Well, that’s the same thing that’s happening here. Earth is the North Korea of the multiverse.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1859","720","1080","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/407336798_1704460690051308_1456974664322801619_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=8j5TplxGFm8Q7kNvgGbLXbq&_nc_gid=aa1e5071a67e4e229b55b89602c4e0f1&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCa842r35h5MYkX-8ujP4eyNKNgZw0_WTc0sUUAs7O2Eg&oe=6716CD48&_nc_sid=10d13b","Actually quite a profound thought","3251242751726642920",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18038455093891241","0","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/456557969_1675066896611534_3154906656696927529_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=oM-rxtcbBo8Q7kNvgEwpoLB&_nc_gid=aa1e5071a67e4e229b55b89602c4e0f1&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBlHpnoYdV6B8PzcFJGdQw4ie9dDXfALDFEd1viK7UdMQ&oe=6716E9D7&_nc_sid=10d13b","__c_lynn_t",,,,,,,,"0","Actually quite a profound thought","2024-08-26T14:57:55.000Z","18035262293089948","2","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/460425760_2607047639465884_3862373130550071788_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=cijjcAQ3UUcQ7kNvgFFqt0m&_nc_gid=aa1e5071a67e4e229b55b89602c4e0f1&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCO9WChyy_bDekfO-FMA8kGnBJadadlWJNH-3tSw3y0yw&oe=6716D00E&_nc_sid=10d13b","lawandluc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","That sounds utterly absurd and yet perfectly logical at the same time.","2024-07-29T20:54:05.000Z","17969485673753486","0","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/420660917_620010596904683_5325449301203229470_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=BuwHOux0bjMQ7kNvgHPtcDd&_nc_gid=aa1e5071a67e4e229b55b89602c4e0f1&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA1w8rIHbXgjPP9zBiwVQtxtFl1T5SVdEfPXnfxFkaW5w&oe=6716CBAE&_nc_sid=10d13b","nikki_vieraa",,,,,,,,"0","Ghosts don't exist and our loved ones don't come back as ghosts.

"Photo by Humans of New York on November 16, 2023.","“I’m turning forty in August. Three kids, full time job. All my kids are under the age of seven. The amount of mental energy it takes, you know, juggling all of them and the constant questions about nothing. I mean, mom is busy, please, just give me a second. My husband tells me that it’s just the season we’re in. We’ll get back to it. But I just want it to slow down so I can pause and breathe. Everything just changes so fast, you know? When you’re a little kid, and you turn into a teenager, it’s like: ‘Oh, I’m changing now.’ But you’ve been coached. You’re prepared for it. Then you go from teenager to college. That’s a big change. Then from college into your twenties, still changing. But at some point you kinda feel like I’m an adult, and I’m done. But you just keep going. It’s like oh shit, no, no, I’m going to keep changing. And these aren’t like the earlier changes. These aren’t the ones you get to plan for. Well some of them are, like: ‘We’re moving to a new place.’ Or ‘I’m going to get a new job.’ Those you can be ready for. But as you get older shit starts getting thrown at you that you're not planning for. Dodgeballs. And you’ve just got to pivot. And all of the sudden you realize-- that moment in time, right before the dodgeball-- that was the last time you saw the old you. And you didn’t even get to say goodbye.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"4438","720","1080","https://instagram.fabe1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/401396956_291443533873175_2332569074806033261_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fabe1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=DZNxWZzVWbgQ7kNvgHCWwgI&_nc_gid=07500972573443cb96af00ff70b770b8&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDPFqr0VT9W7-uijqHefo0vsYMNXYHlKtGkVgfPuYO2fw&oe=6716BB9A&_nc_sid=10d13b","Thank feminism for this.

"Photo by Humans of New York on October 12, 2023.","“Picture it, okay? Mardi Gras. New Orleans. Bourbon Street.  I’m on college break with my three best childhood friends. Zak is there with his parents. He’s got his mom and dad with him. So it’s two different vibes, but somehow we all end up on the balcony of the same bar. Everyone’s got beads in their hands. We’re all yelling to see boobs. Well, I’m yelling to see boobs. That was just me. But Zak had a perfect mustache. He used to grow it much longer and curl it with wax. And I normally don’t approach people, I’m not that person. But his whole family seemed cute. They didn’t seem like normal New Orleans vacation people. So I was like: ‘Can I take a picture with you?’ Then we ended up adding each other on Snapchat, because that was the thing back then. And we agreed to meet up the next day after his family was done with their gator cruise and I was finished visiting the strip club. That night we walked along the river until the sun came up. I remember doing handstands on the levees. Then at the end we kissed. It was just a kiss because I was leaving early the next morning, and honestly I thought that would be the end of it. I thought for sure I was never going to see this kid again. But we kept talking, and two weeks later I’m taking his virginity in a Las Vegas hotel room. There was something going on with his stomach that day. Right when we finished he went to the bathroom and started throwing up. I called my girlfriend and said: ‘I don’t think he likes me.’ But it’s been love ever since.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1705","720","1080","https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/390925549_336697532189175_3898176132434558134_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=hXsgqT1XQa0Q7kNvgGXOG4L&_nc_gid=e16c0849b66a4b3dae69e6c3ba2da029&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAzogg5n3DRP-xUMQaGp8sxB0T_VXeWoXxxQAYMb8ineQ&oe=6716CAB4&_nc_sid=10d13b","Hello","3212002584767909263",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18067685800590367","0","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/440547862_966060101393329_3550001181120825292_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=pmBrop7zwaMQ7kNvgEe7vgT&_nc_gid=e16c0849b66a4b3dae69e6c3ba2da029&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBMPyiSQi12aa0vD5g-PVuvqo0SlbjdLHGC1lozlf-kvg&oe=6716CD42&_nc_sid=10d13b","sandralovermary5",,,,,,,,"0","Hello","2024-08-30T20:09:59.000Z","18024605644750176","5","https://scontent-atl3-3.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/338939801_198037499602521_5102851847427949973_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-3.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=Tln7oS_xgaEQ7kNvgGaX_sP&_nc_gid=e16c0849b66a4b3dae69e6c3ba2da029&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD01ca8KwgMFW0HeJ2S1mKNkuYmADKV3ilyPWm78tTFaQ&oe=6716C36A&_nc_sid=10d13b","jcolleen_",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","What an absolutely positively adorable couple.

"Photo by Humans of New York on November 01, 2023.","“They told me they loved me constantly, chronically, every day. They gave me a good home. They cared for me. They did all the basics, and above all that: they worked hard to put me in a great school district. But no matter how much they provide, your parents can’t give a shit for you. I made every bad choice a high schooler could make: tv, video games, pornography. All the stuff that you use to not think about stuff. It’s immediately gratifying, maybe the first 50 or 100 times. But after the 200th time, that stuff becomes who you are. I guess the whole time I was just hoping that someone would come along and tell me exactly what to do with my life, or else it would just come to me. Maybe that happens for some people. But for the other ninety percent of us, we have to make the conscious decision to just go. At first I told my dad I was joining The Marines. He’s an attorney. It certainly wasn’t what he would have chosen for me. But he said: ‘If this is what you want to do, you’re going to visit every branch. You’re going to make an educated decision.’ On the day I signed with the Coast Guard, I remember telling him: ‘I just want to be a good man.’ That’s as far as I’d gotten. That’s the only thing I knew for sure. I didn’t know where the path was going to lead, but I was just tired of not trying. I figured it was better to just start walking and see what the hell happens.

I’ve got enough money for us to get home. Then I’ve got to find a way to get something to eat. I’ve got to pay bills. We’re starting to get foreclosure letters in the mail. It’s just impossible to make ends meet right now, unless you’ve got school. I’m educated, but I just don’t have any degrees. I have no way of showing to a job that’s never met me: ‘Hey, I can do this.’ Plus I never know how it’s going to turn out, and that alone scares me. Maybe I’m just a pussy, I don’t know. I’m not proud of the stuff I’m selling. I’ve seen what it’s done to my mom, which is why I don’t use it. I don’t want that for my kids. I don’t want it to fuck up their life like it fucked up my life and my mom’s. That’s how I actually learned about it. Seeing how she’d fight to get that shit, no matter what. I know I could be selling to someone else’s mom. I hear that little voice in my head, like everyone else. But I block that out. I’m on autopilot. Quick exchange: I get my money, I give them their stuff.  I block everything else out and I’m only looking at what I need, you feel me? And yeah it sounds evil, or whatever. But I weigh what I need more, and I need stability. I just need money. Money for my kids. Money for me. Money for like, all of us. Money so I don’t have to feel that stress of where am I going to get this next. And it’s the most accessible thing. It’s the easiest thing to get.

You start out making art, and hoping that the door will open. You’re looking for that viral moment so it opens up the door and you can do the thing full time. But you start to compromise just to get the door to open: guessing what it wants, debasing yourself, alienating yourself. Until you’re not even in service to your art anymore. You’re in service to the algorithm. Deep down every artist just wants to be seen. Everyone does. And that’s how it controls you. The algorithm makes you behave in a certain way, create in a certain way, in exchange for being seen. And if something can change what you do, it can change who you are.

"Photo by Humans of New York on October 19, 2023.","“It’s been a tough morning for me. I used to be a children’s librarian. But this morning I had to call publishers and tell them not to send me any more books. I just can’t read them anymore, not like I used to. And that was hard. It felt like I was cutting off a lifeline. It’s disappointing, the sense of not being in control of my own life anymore. Everything depends on my medical schedule, and the chemotherapy, and what my limits are. The doctor has told me to expect a couple more years, but my caretaker says she’s seen a lot of sick people. And she thinks I could be one of the ones who can beat it. For most of my life happiness was automatic. I might have had the only career where you get told ‘I love you’ three or four times a week. Maybe it happens with teachers too, but so many little kids said those words to me over the years. And I miss that. I was damned lucky to have that experience. Happiness isn’t automatic anymore, these days I have to work a little bit more for it. In addition to all the pain and the fear and having to pee all the time, I choose to do a lot of things that will make me aware of the beauty and loveliness of life. It's not magic. I don’t stop thinking about the scary stuff, I just find moments to push them aside with the ridiculous. There’s so much in life that’s ridiculous. Every Saturday morning I watch Popeye on Turner Classic Movies. It’s so ridiculous. Olive Oil is so obnoxious. And you know, she has all these men after her. It’s just really funny. And Popeye is so full of himself and somehow manages to come out of everything, eat his spinach, and win. Then there’s my laughing yoga classes, which I can’t do in person anymore. But I do them online. There’s this thing we do where people will get in lines of three or four, and we’ll pretend to have a boat race. Everyone rows as hard as they can. Someone chooses a winner, and if you lose you get to create a big scene and make an ass of yourself. It’s ridiculous. And then there’s you. You’re ridiculous. You’re stopping random people, presumably to entertain yourself. You’re sitting in the middle of the street. I mean, think about it.

All we do is fucking work on cars and bikes and snowmobiles and four wheelers and then go riding, and afterward we try to get naked with our old ladies.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 30, 2023.","“I grew up with strangers. I wasn’t even with my parents from first to fifth grade. All the people that were supposed to care for me, and teach me, and guide me, they all failed me. It caused a lot of anger and honestly, a lot of heartbreak. I even wondered if my family was cursed. Like all we do is come into this world and we struggle. From the age of twelve I had to go straight home from school and take care of my baby sister. I was the one making sure she was OK: feeding her, changing her, bathing her. It’s like my life was in shackles. I didn’t even start playing basketball for real until I was sixteen. That was the summer I was like: ‘I’m done. I’m not y’all’s babysitter.’ I started waking up early and going to the park for hours, doing drills. Basketball gave me a sense of control. The more I worked, the better I got, and it was like: ‘Wow. I can really do this.’ It’s like I was finally the one writing my story. I ended up trying out for the school team my senior year: no skills, no talent, just starting to understand the game. But the things I could do, I did better than everyone else: diving for loose balls, grabbing rebounds, and hustling. It was mainly hustle. And I think the coach saw that, or maybe he just felt sorry for me. Because he created an extra spot on the roster just for me. There weren’t even enough uniforms, I had a different uniform than everybody else, and during the away games the crowd would let me know. They let me hear it, but I didn’t care. I was just so happy to be there. I couldn’t shoot, but I’d go one hundred percent on defense. The coach would put me on the other team’s best player. I’d stay right up under his jersey. I’d chase him all over the court. And by the end of the year I was in the rotation. We won the city championship that year. During the final game our starters got off to a slow start, and the coach wanted some energy. So he looked down to the end of the bench and said: ‘Rey, go in.’ Right away I got a steal.

,"From 2015 to 2018 I filmed about 1200 interviews on the streets of New York along with the super talented cinematographer @shoottheplan. It was certainly the hardest I’ve ever worked on a single project. We did our best to cover the whole city: we filmed for hundreds of days and walked thousands of miles. A small portion of these interviews were woven into a show that debuted on Facebook Watch; which remains one of my favorite things to have come out of Humans of New York. Recently I revisited the collection for the first time in years, and was reminded of how many amazing people and beautiful moments there were. So alongside the current written stories, I’ll be sharing some of my favorites over the next few months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1279","1333","750","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/403833533_276211158713013_5930955039559903172_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=x6GUov29bEkQ7kNvgGgLoV0&_nc_gid=b9b41508d42f431db799ccc39262533e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB6b3MbM3pxUteTx77Bu3CV7Jj5MlqZjs7g8g2yw_MtWw&oe=6716E943&_nc_sid=10d13b","Love this so much!

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 25, 2023.","“Growing up I was very much in my own head, my own world. Instead of getting a babysitter my mom would just go to work and leave me at the house. We didn’t have a TV or anything. And when there’s no one to talk to, you just become your own friend. I’d look out the window and try to imagine myself doing things. Like: ‘What would it be like if I was standing on that roof? What sort of things would I see?’ But when you do that too much, at some point you get lost. I didn’t even feel alone. It’s hard to explain, because I haven’t experienced nothing else. But it's like: you don’t feel lonely if there’s never nobody else there. And there was never nobody else there. Alone was my normal. It was my comfortable. So when we first started dating, I didn’t know what to do. Every time we were alone I would speak non-stop. Then I’d stop myself mid-sentence and be like, ‘Damn. I’m speaking a lot. I need to shut up.’ And she’d be like: ‘No, just keep telling me what you were telling me.’ I was just so excited. I felt like l a kid with a new toy. I’m not calling her a toy, that’s not what I mean. But that’s how I felt. Like I don’t know how this works, but I can’t believe I have it. I’m in love now. For so long I’d told myself: ‘This is never going to happen.’ But then it actually happened. It was like: ‘What do I do? Where do I go now?’ Every day has been something new. Monday feels like Saturday, because every day has meaning. I’m figuring out about her, and about myself, and about the world. Like—I didn’t know you could have fun in winter. There’s so many indoor activities you can do, just simple things. Like wearing matching pajamas on New Years. I never knew about that stuff. It can be so fulfilling. Sometimes you don’t even have to do anything. Just having somebody sitting next to you makes you feel nice inside. And that’s how it is now. That’s how my life is. She’s my comfortable.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 15, 2023.","(52/54) “It always sits out on the shelf. It’s given structure to my life. I’ve wanted to be a knight. I’ve wanted to be a king. I’ve wanted to be Ferdowsi, living for higher ideals. But there’s old men in Shahnameh too. And that’s my idea of a king now—a grandfather. A 𝘉𝘶𝘣𝘫𝘢𝘯. He’s more of a cultural figure. He advises his grandchildren. He keeps them together. But he doesn’t participate in their issues, regardless of how they behave. He’s like a book. He’s full of wisdom. He's there if you need him, but he doesn’t exert power over you. I’m reading it through one last time, with all eight of my grandchildren. It’s a deeper understanding now. To dive deep requires a philosopher’s tenacity, but the pearls are in the depths of the seas. These days I skim over the battle scenes. I read more diligently the parts that tell of universal values like love and kindness. The parts that are true for everyone. One of my favorite stories never made it into Shahnameh. It was passed down through our oral traditions. Iran is in the midst of the longest war it has ever fought. The fighting has gone on for more than a century. Many kings have died, both sides are exhausted, and a truce is proposed. A single champion from the Iranian side is selected. His name is Arash, ‘The Archer.’ He’s told to climb one of the highest mountains in Iran, and to shoot his arrow as far as he’s able. And wherever it lands, that will be the border of the new Iran. He climbs to the mountain’s peak. He pulls back his bow as far as he can, and he lets the arrow fly. It sails across the entire country. And sticks into a walnut tree—exactly where the previous border was before. Before the fighting, before the bloodshed. And that’s the new Iran. But Arash never gets to see it. He put his entire soul into the arrow. All of his 𝘑𝘢𝘢𝘯. And the moment it’s released, he falls over and dies.”","Photo by Humans of New York on September 15, 2023.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/378778966_279500321545189_6489598318674194671_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=jJIu7U7wjGsQ7kNvgHVcv-Q&_nc_gid=5e459a02f8304f45a793464caed550c3&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCpr3E4waydSK89qGguMR7hrEkgCBwq0xbiOzxDg_kVcQ&oe=6716BC5D&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3192687841531314032",,,"CxOtK0hLr9w",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxOtK0hLr9w/","Photo by Humans of New York on September 15, 2023.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/378933305_323704966897972_7890776344201463916_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=NtjUyCIc7H4Q7kNvgEMhu4h&_nc_gid=5e459a02f8304f45a793464caed550c3&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB-aVB2j4mUVt_QM1L8OgLqmhVKtNVrcKoXmDAVHqkr_w&oe=6716C3EB&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3192687841178994822",,,"CxOtK0MLsiG",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxOtK0MLsiG/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"129","720","1080","https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/378778966_279500321545189_6489598318674194671_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=jJIu7U7wjGsQ7kNvgHVcv-Q&_nc_gid=5e459a02f8304f45a793464caed550c3&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCpr3E4waydSK89qGguMR7hrEkgCBwq0xbiOzxDg_kVcQ&oe=6716BC5D&_nc_sid=10d13b","👏✨️","3192687847713694827","https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/378778966_279500321545189_6489598318674194671_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=jJIu7U7wjGsQ7kNvgHVcv-Q&_nc_gid=5e459a02f8304f45a793464caed550c3&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCpr3E4waydSK89qGguMR7hrEkgCBwq0xbiOzxDg_kVcQ&oe=6716BC5D&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/378933305_323704966897972_7890776344201463916_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=NtjUyCIc7H4Q7kNvgEMhu4h&_nc_gid=5e459a02f8304f45a793464caed550c3&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB-aVB2j4mUVt_QM1L8OgLqmhVKtNVrcKoXmDAVHqkr_w&oe=6716C3EB&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17975660489405064","0","https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/461451005_26969875075991226_1390568576371536245_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=rkUeJ85BiZ4Q7kNvgHV54z-&_nc_gid=5e459a02f8304f45a793464caed550c3&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBEweTe7IMFIzruLAgFrAWVyMLhZ_amb98AraxW1XXmYQ&oe=6716C2EF&_nc_sid=10d13b","sadafkiyaniyan26",,,,,,,,"0","👏✨️","2023-10-29T20:18:54.000Z","17987588108514255","3","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/449430359_1844929555976169_3153933618296055406_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=3_5Jz0_DTaQQ7kNvgHcCjW2&_nc_gid=5e459a02f8304f45a793464caed550c3&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCBF4DsP9ndXw5DzM2Qa6HOV7RQirVu3vytqc3CErHIjA&oe=6716EEC8&_nc_sid=10d13b","dinafocakovic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","His words & his outlook give me… so much hope.

The impatience is building, and soon it will come out. Iran will come out. Our young women have been leading us. But we cannot let them march one-by-one into the night. Do not pass by silently if a woman is getting harassed in the street. Do not let them be called whores or sluts. Speak! Say this is not right! Your neighbor will hear you, and they will say it too. Until all of us are saying it together. The only way to take the battlefield is together. Those of us in free societies, with the freedom to speak, and write, and protest. Do not sit behind the walls of your castle. Write. Speak. Protest. We don’t need the same chants, or the same slogans.  But let us come together. Even if it’s only around our dining room tables, let us come together. We cannot let them face the enemy alone. In Iran they are standing up: the students of Tehran, the truck drivers of Bandar Abbas, the oil workers of Khuzestan, the factory workers of Pooladshahr, the teachers of Sanandaj, the farmers of Isfahan. Everyone has found their own way of saying: ‘This does not work for us.’ Everyone is choosing their own words, but now let us say them all together. If you can’t find the courage to march in the streets, then just open your doors. Stand on your stoop as the protesters pass. That would be enough. If everyone who is against this regime could only do that, we’d fill all of Iran. It will be the end. These enforcers will realize that there is no one with them. Because those policeman, those soldiers, they’re also the people. Iran lives inside of them too. There is only one battle left. The fight against fear. When we win against the fear in our hearts, we win Iran. And in the words of Ferdowsi: ‘Without fighting, they will flee the scene.’”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"205","720","1080","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/379397475_1059291955245287_5535756921326532944_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=T4A7B24Ru00Q7kNvgFEmKqJ&_nc_gid=d22868f9b23a4db68d14ce37755c429e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBV11l9lddmE_EkcE-9aAqye-oDxoKYFy_KPcCWKsuQvQ&oe=6716DAD3&_nc_sid=10d13b","Wowwowow","3192657256230176736",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18037895650641422","1","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/441085272_643987834571163_3070296961811198200_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=Jsl37JtORgEQ7kNvgHCtOTA&_nc_gid=d22868f9b23a4db68d14ce37755c429e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCMUBIQ9Bxuc3ZMmj7EtpykNlxCwiwg9zd_3lYX-2oiZA&oe=6716C472&_nc_sid=10d13b","mother_terina",,,,,,,,"0","Wowwowow","2024-01-15T08:09:58.000Z","18057806590468389","1","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/283106462_1638244923204795_6718259258601466437_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=tILlPIIMImAQ7kNvgE10O6j&_nc_gid=d22868f9b23a4db68d14ce37755c429e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCT36n22WT-SCgYLDWVenT-PzbSdqvrVOGJzJBDCXYW_A&oe=6716D1B3&_nc_sid=10d13b","sharoneffeff",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","His passion and idealism are so inspiring! 👊🏼✊🏼💪🏼","2023-11-10T19:03:13.000Z","18207107770266332","0","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/193798030_308626830790738_1846701696687013730_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=YSd6Yywzg0wQ7kNvgGfFYJk&_nc_gid=d22868f9b23a4db68d14ce37755c429e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCZW96SvFAISdZD1HNBmdjcBblgQNlvdrCSnM1y46ITlQ&oe=6716EB95&_nc_sid=10d13b","nahid_zarghami95",,,,,,,,"0","بادرود سرور پرویز عزیزم ناهید دختر عمه گلین هستم از صمیم قلب دوستت دارم ارادتمند سرور مهربانم هستم .❤️❤️😍😍","2023-10-12T18:39:53.000Z","17967113105619432","0","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/10632260_340741206101372_2017427787_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=zA147jxw49YQ7kNvgFHOByE&_nc_gid=d22868f9b23a4db68d14ce37755c429e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAX-wxxf_z-wH-XQNwO0DrjnF7zBuVuKykPCtSgAh6lsg&oe=6716C0BE&_nc_sid=10d13b","tlazare45","18070704379419694","1","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/10632260_340741206101372_2017427787_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=zA147jxw49YQ7kNvgFHOByE&_nc_gid=d22868f9b23a4db68d14ce37755c429e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAX-wxxf_z-wH-XQNwO0DrjnF7zBuVuKykPCtSgAh6lsg&oe=6716C0BE&_nc_sid=10d13b","tlazare45","0","@tlazare45 fight against fear 😰","2023-09-24T15:05:54.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1","The fight against dear 😢","2023-09-24T15:05:04.000Z","17911092773815684","1","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/242683887_422788582779701_4518541170824983244_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=mpw2MfbWpUMQ7kNvgHspa5N&_nc_gid=d22868f9b23a4db68d14ce37755c429e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB7Jc5v23eSTyOWJ34eQy_VhR8j6bQimxYAhiv7fhSHbA&oe=6716E5F1&_nc_sid=10d13b","immelmo","0","Merci","2023-09-21T23:49:19.000Z","18030331936609058","1","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/408290420_622195739957205_4908829528150645641_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=rzibrmhEri0Q7kNvgHjTInl&_nc_gid=d22868f9b23a4db68d14ce37755c429e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYALCPT3-YMCvqAje3CygnGGyc1PDc2ej3dH73w7qkWwgA&oe=6716C737&_nc_sid=10d13b","bongionn",,,,,,,,"0","#women_life_freedom","2023-09-20T23:24:13.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"31402",,,,,,,,,,"Humans of New York","242598499","humansofny",,"CxOmNvvLEfg","2023-09-15T21:47:05.000Z","Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxOmNvvLEfg/",,,,
"Photo by Humans of New York on September 17, 2023.","I want to begin by thanking Parviz Zafari. Though it seems strange to say his name, because I’ve only ever heard him called Bubjan, which means Grandfather. When I met Bubjan I only intended his story to be a single post. But as his life began to unspool before me, putting his soul and wisdom into a story became a mission for me. I’ve never met a man who so lived what he believed. You’ve been a great teacher to me, Bubjan. Thank you for showing me that truth is something you do.  
 
Thank you to my close friend @rostamzafari. It was his devotion to his grandfather that sparked all of this. I joke that he dragged me into his house and sat me at Bubjan’s feet. Rostam would also serve as interpreter for all 100 hours of interviews. Rostam is one of the most brilliant, talented, and ethical people I’ve ever met. He is very much like his grandfather, only he took his love of Shahnameh a step further by tattooing scenes from the book all over his body.  
 
I want to thank the entire Zafari family: every member played a part in this. Mitra, you are the sun. Thanks to Sepanta Mohseni for holding us together. Thank you to Dr. Maziar Zafari, who I call ‘The General.’ He was a chief advisor to the whole project and ripped my drafts to shreds until all the history was correct. We locked horns a few times, but we are better friends because of it. And the story is certainly better because of it. 
 
Thank you to Azadeh Vatanpour and Rashid Fani, for creating a translation so good that it was often referred to as the ‘original Farsi version.’ (With an assist from Dr. Zafari.) Thank you to my agent Brian DeFiore, first and last fingerprints on all my stories. Thank you to my beautiful wife Erin, for loving me despite my obsessions. Thank you to everyone who supports Humans of New York on Patreon—you are the reason I have the space and time to do this work.  
 
Thank you to the God of Soul and Wisdom, as God is called in this story. Do the next good thing, a way appears. Thank you to Mahsa Jina Amini and the women of Iran, you continue to inspire us.  
And lastly, thanks to all of you who read these stories.

I’d spend a day in Tehran. I’d visit Persepolis, to see the ruins. I’d go to Nahavand, to see my people. To meet their children. And the children of their children. And then I’d go to his tomb. He was buried in his garden. And to stand there one more time, where he tended his trees. Where he sowed his seeds. Seven verses a day. I’d say them quietly in my head, I wouldn’t want to disturb the peace. But something happens, I can’t help it. I feel the heat. I feel the pressure. It’s like a sword pierces my body and I have to let it out: 𝘙𝘢𝘬𝘩𝘴𝘩 𝘳𝘰𝘢𝘳𝘦𝘥 𝘣𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘩 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘮! The thunder of hooves, the spark of swords, the clash of axes, the single arrow spinning through the air. 𝘞𝘩𝘰 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘴𝘦 𝘗𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘪𝘢𝘯𝘴? Rumi, Saadi, Hafez, Khayyam, Ferdowsi. Not even a lion! Not even a lion could stand against them! Our kings. Our queens. Our castles. Our battles. Our banquets. Our songs and celebrations. Our culture. Our wisdom. Our choices. Our story. And our words. All of our words. Words of mothers, words of fathers, words that teach, words that fly, words that cut, words that heal, words laughed, words sung, words wept, words prayed, words whispered in a moonlit garden, words of sin, words kissed, words sighed, words spoken from one knee. 𝘔𝘦𝘩𝘳. Words forgotten. Words remembered again. Words written on a page. Words etched on the face of a tomb. 𝘑𝘢𝘢𝘯. 𝘒𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘥. A castle of words! That no wind or rain will destroy! Who we were. Who we were! But also, who we wanted to be. We begin in darkness. A siren screams. A knight appears. A knight with the heart of a lion. A knight with a voice to make, the hardened hearts of warriors quake. A knight who rode out to face the enemy alone, and she roared. She roared! She roared at the enemy lines! Here! Here is your champion! Her wisdom, her soul, her voice, her faith, her power, her heart, her passion, her sin, her choice, her life, her fight, her fire, her fury, her justice! And her hair.

He told me how beautiful his country was and how sad it was that nobody knew. I trusted him, I knew he spoke the truth. You have just enriched his story ten fold, and I know now more than ever how right he was. Blessings to you and yours, may the coming years bring you peace and happiness.

I wanted to recite a verse, from the part of Shahnameh when Rostam selects Rakhsh as his horse. But no matter how hard I tried, I could not remember the line. For almost a minute I sat still. After that I stopped giving speeches. I’m at a new stage now. I’ve accepted this. It’s like an arrow that’s descending. It’s been a long flight. But it’s nearly reached its destination. I’ve done all I can. So now I try to think through the soul of our people. It’s in the hands of the young people now. They’re the ones with energy. They’re the ones that can change the regime. In the great battles of Shahnameh, as long as the flag is flying high—the army remains strong. The flag must stay raised. When the flag falls, the battle is lost. The flag of this regime is the hijab. For as long as I can remember. For my entire life, it’s the thing they’ve cared about most. It’s something that can be visualized. Something that can be seen from afar. No matter how low they sink, no matter how weak they are, it’s the one proof that they’re still in control. That they still control half of Iran. They’ve made it their flag. But their castle is surrounded. The flag is falling fast. And when it finally hits the ground, the regime will end. Mitra and I do whatever we can to support. We go to the protests.  She wears her ‘Woman, Life, Freedom’ hat. She doesn’t remember the exact dates, or the exact events. But she can feel it in the air. She knows something’s coming. She brought home two Mahsa Jina Amini T-shirts from one of the protests. She hung one in our living room, and the other in our bedroom. I can not fight it, her word is law. Lately she has become obsessed with the idea of going back to Iran. She thinks we’re going home. She’s always saying: Where are we going to live? Who are we going to see? It’s not a delusion. The hope is inside her. And is inside of me too. I still hope that I will live to see it. The new Iran. Just a glimpse would be enough for me. As Ferdowsi writes: ‘Even a few drops sipped at the end of evil, is worth more than all the years of life.”","Photo by Humans of New York on September 15, 2023.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 15, 2023.","(49/54) “We still take long walks together, even today. There’s a path through the forest near our house. Mitra still can’t stand the silence. She’ll walk off the path so she can hear the dry crunch of the leaves. She still talks the entire time, but these days our conversations don’t reach back as far as they used to. We mainly talk about the things we see. She’ll count her steps, count the houses, count the trees. Mitra’s memory is no longer her friend; it no longer supports her. But she still says ‘hello’ to everyone that she sees. And she’s still a queen, I am always at her service. These days we have become inseparable. If I do not see her for two minutes, I will find what room she’s in. I button her jacket. I tie her shoes. I handle all her medications. I do not grieve the situation. I feel gratitude that I am able to do these things for her, despite nature. My only grief is for her. Her memory was her greatest gift. It’s where I stored my treasures. I could tell her any verse, even once. And she could remember it forever. Now it will escape her after only a minute. Every day her world gets smaller and smaller. Tighter and tighter. It’s the oldest memories that she remembers most now. Recently she has been fixated on her hand. She keeps holding up her crippled hand, and asking: ‘Why did you ever marry me?’ When we were young in Tehran, her father had a tradition. Every morning he would insist on having the first cup of tea. He said it was the one that tasted best. He called it ‘the flower of the tea.’ So now when I brew our tea every morning, I will wait. Until Mitra is up. Until she’s ready. So that I can serve her the flower of the tea. Then as soon as we’ve finished the kettle, she’ll make me go outside. And pour the remains on the roots of our trees.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"833","720","1080","https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/378474088_756463162953979_5067353501375373676_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=n39ADrlLe58Q7kNvgF1mHhG&_nc_gid=a0d9df276e9d48bcb0d0740d4f3f27e4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCDV49dLqsESUSe9e9_3k3B-xwOWS1h9RepBZxRpBvWYQ&oe=6716C78C&_nc_sid=10d13b","howw cute!","3192587078621308796",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17854524873214858","0","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/458441256_883685690318321_6740149502690476971_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=kXhUjnPyaxkQ7kNvgFr9vEw&_nc_gid=a0d9df276e9d48bcb0d0740d4f3f27e4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCE8CHux_fnVVzRnrT9RDA0_IuUQi8lXhziTMMdcQdJYA&oe=6716BD0C&_nc_sid=10d13b","m_aria_1967",,,,,,,,"0","howw cute!","2024-07-03T11:28:14.000Z","17941801835824151","0","https://instagram.fpgz2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/44884218_345707102882519_2446069589734326272_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e0_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fpgz2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=CWrd8f4xNJwQ7kNvgHysaT9&_nc_gid=5ed070c5e51f4aec8ea67262d309e63b&edm=AGqCYasBAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=YW5vbnltb3VzX3Byb2ZpbGVfcGlj.3-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYDW0Ih44CspKEEH3oLM2DjmEOZsyJ3_ydo_xNrVNLdXkA&oe=6716D24F&_nc_sid=6c5dea","xena_fisher",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2024-06-11T02:12:53.000Z","17992327070434552","0","https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/371164324_673471364698404_8733592139246418030_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=EWX_nJNf2R8Q7kNvgGyaWfU&_nc_gid=a0d9df276e9d48bcb0d0740d4f3f27e4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCHrZAFsVoYYwMNsftgma_KYagiOHoy_6R7nFQj0pPlwA&oe=6716BA46&_nc_sid=10d13b","putrilucuw",,,,,,,,"0","so touching endless love","2024-04-12T06:14:36.000Z","17944427807741163","0","https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/457014159_850706710400748_8257411771433516229_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=SnosWfhZF3sQ7kNvgEs9_cA&_nc_gid=a0d9df276e9d48bcb0d0740d4f3f27e4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAUqLm4BKCVfML3ZA30LJAOpsrAu_NSm_Jz1XjeIzaDXA&oe=6716E387&_nc_sid=10d13b","alicefeatwonderland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","❤️♾️","2023-11-23T13:02:18.000Z","17988189356400658","0","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/457234936_2001253116961906_4889285597722633263_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=Tet9qzfD6jUQ7kNvgFTZdhZ&_nc_gid=a0d9df276e9d48bcb0d0740d4f3f27e4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBPghV-6t09ZuYVpNbGHd2uFhgOG2CcOVuMP7Drw60LvQ&oe=6716CC1E&_nc_sid=10d13b","etemadikatayoon","0","❤️❤️","2023-11-03T18:58:13.000Z","18101865907348344","0","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/119469969_949335955549276_7899563965185604499_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=fTcE1493yQ8Q7kNvgGq-OsB&_nc_gid=a0d9df276e9d48bcb0d0740d4f3f27e4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCXE9PQgTQP1Fl2Zy94PM_Uqcq9cVhmAp_IMp5eF6xqTA&oe=6716EC1E&_nc_sid=10d13b","thenatalian",,,,,,,,"0","🔥🔥🔥🔥","2023-10-13T20:27:32.000Z","17946622745703640","0","https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/331865880_883949206211412_5376006464870904552_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=nmXofhH-VJUQ7kNvgF29GOQ&_nc_gid=a0d9df276e9d48bcb0d0740d4f3f27e4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCgLii_nL0SsdmBsLJZbiO_YIA8IjtTKYmBk_lXkYp7eg&oe=6716BA44&_nc_sid=10d13b","paulalovespink",,,,,,,,"0","❤️😭","2023-10-07T04:11:49.000Z","18000528685969002","0","https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/350236732_812323543745415_5609071646945697927_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=nTZ8m3gnYXQQ7kNvgGsvHL5&_nc_gid=a0d9df276e9d48bcb0d0740d4f3f27e4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB8r0n52W6KOh7y4Vt7fDmRTvrP-lXgns8UBJGOMjd3VA&oe=6716C8D5&_nc_sid=10d13b","nasrinbabaeidesign",,,,,,,,"0","Love is a two-way road.

"Photo by Humans of New York on January 04, 2024.","“I’m taking a break from school until I figure things out. I guess I have rebel traits. There were just so many things that felt out of my control, and it bothered me. You have to wake up at this time. You have to go do this. You have to go do that. It’s like I didn’t have any originality. There was a certain point when I realized that everything-- this whole routine that I had, had been given to me by other people. And the weird thing is—whenever you try to remove yourself from that equation, and stop doing what other people want, you kind of get ostracized and outcast. That’s kinda what happened to me. I have a great family, but it’s full of strong personalities. I had so many people telling me: do this, do that. They said it was a ‘respect’ thing. You know: ‘I’m the adult, so you should respect me.’ But I never understood that. Because at what age do I get this thing called respect? Nobody in my family could ever answer that question. Is it when I have a kid? Is that it? Or is it when I'm paying a certain amount of bills? At what point do I step up on the pedestal?”","Photo by Humans of New York on January 04, 2024.","","0","720","1080","https://instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/416257343_1860515827741813_5971326335393653512_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=tUV1ajb-Yy0Q7kNvgHWmW9H&_nc_gid=049edda591c94fec88ef252cb1aec131&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAUDW-b98_88Kv5dYi0Cs-aIcMC_CKVzwUoMkF_ztw7FA&oe=6716E77D&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3273035305887429028",,,"C1sKET4u3Gk",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/C1sKET4u3Gk/","Photo by Humans of New York on January 04, 2024.","","0","720","1080","https://instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/416932126_337472675880974_2898282513235640206_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=_u_CdYB6mgsQ7kNvgHRcJTT&_nc_gid=049edda591c94fec88ef252cb1aec131&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAsab845mRKUxWUiMwi8mHiuvxEp93uLoJSeJRAD7qMbQ&oe=6716D3E9&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3273035305820097452",,,"C1sKET0uAus",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/C1sKET0uAus/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1195","720","1080","https://instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/416257343_1860515827741813_5971326335393653512_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=tUV1ajb-Yy0Q7kNvgHWmW9H&_nc_gid=049edda591c94fec88ef252cb1aec131&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAUDW-b98_88Kv5dYi0Cs-aIcMC_CKVzwUoMkF_ztw7FA&oe=6716E77D&_nc_sid=10d13b","very story 👏🏻","3273035311138729958","https://instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/416257343_1860515827741813_5971326335393653512_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=tUV1ajb-Yy0Q7kNvgHWmW9H&_nc_gid=049edda591c94fec88ef252cb1aec131&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAUDW-b98_88Kv5dYi0Cs-aIcMC_CKVzwUoMkF_ztw7FA&oe=6716E77D&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/416932126_337472675880974_2898282513235640206_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=_u_CdYB6mgsQ7kNvgHRcJTT&_nc_gid=049edda591c94fec88ef252cb1aec131&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAsab845mRKUxWUiMwi8mHiuvxEp93uLoJSeJRAD7qMbQ&oe=6716D3E9&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18039743404931396","0","https://instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/448312159_345485695031297_2181155246384534857_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=z42DtCBeevMQ7kNvgFRXX32&_nc_gid=049edda591c94fec88ef252cb1aec131&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCfziv2Yf4gRqNMJ2fDL5iYkDh1ZmxaC5tnk0fvnyhguQ&oe=6716C493&_nc_sid=10d13b","gabriellafonsecar",,,,,,,,"0","very story 👏🏻","2024-07-03T11:28:53.000Z","17913841226952470","0","https://instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/132042965_134665391643611_5674860053194046964_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=Om8QYqyOzT4Q7kNvgFI3LV4&_nc_gid=049edda591c94fec88ef252cb1aec131&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD1nE78qlItTwdfRM_lv7OJyasSk9SjZq85LPxNz3S7nQ&oe=6716E6AC&_nc_sid=10d13b","xen27420",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Love from India We also want to connect with you","2024-06-21T18:41:11.000Z","18008736995274148","0","https://instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/453428073_1009844307502244_3318763280533122776_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=KYlG5Pe2eEcQ7kNvgEwwpyz&_nc_gid=049edda591c94fec88ef252cb1aec131&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDrBm-Z4t0-tfb4k45lR_owi5FjalfczANOTWWFJvb4MA&oe=6716DD9B&_nc_sid=10d13b","goldenauraastrologer",,,,,,,,"0","That’s always my problem too.","2024-06-14T04:42:31.000Z","18002980877615684","0","https://instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/339515995_720571943095350_5410372389516597454_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=MxMjnDWQ9okQ7kNvgFN02Un&_nc_gid=049edda591c94fec88ef252cb1aec131&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAYXoV4oCtBlw85cig-2gzewJWds6NEXJeWqO768DJaYQ&oe=6716D243&_nc_sid=10d13b","yurij_ivanchuk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","I think its not a good idea, because you waste your time(","2024-05-27T05:28:43.000Z","17928720863855215","0","https://instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/460752249_1010103957560778_3001855913542031450_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=GLox71ynmsoQ7kNvgEc8fb_&_nc_gid=049edda591c94fec88ef252cb1aec131&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDROq9n8474fZULKu9Emp_DKj4-MkKbFbIWKQo3qYVI7w&oe=6716DE6E&_nc_sid=10d13b","blankzappa","0","when you prove you can do whatever you want and still be alright, that's when you get respect -

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 22, 2023.","“I’ve been doing good work lately. My schoolwork, I mean. God that sounds so nerdy. But this year I’ve been trying to make school less about the grade and more about doing work that makes me proud. To put it bluntly, I wrote some good fucking essays this year. There’s this one paper called The Term Paper. Every junior has to do it. It’s six to eight pages. Just say the words ‘The Term Paper’ to a sophomore, and they will cower in fear. It’s supposed to be the culmination of everything you’ve learned about literature. Everyone begins by making their proposal to the teacher. The coolest thing about essays, as opposed to say math, is that they’re one of the only chances you get in high school to say something original. So I was like: ‘Let’s go, let’s push it.’ We were supposed to choose one book. But I told my teacher: ‘There’s an author I love named Kazuo Ishiguro, and I’d like to compare two of his books.’ She told me nobody had ever asked that before, but she let me do it. And for the longest time it seemed like I’d made a huge mistake. It took me six months. It was such a complicated argument, it took me almost twenty pages. I felt so tired. I had no idea if I was going to finish on time. Even with an extension, I turned it in fifteen minutes before the deadline. But when she gave me the paper back, she said something I couldn’t believe. She said: ‘This is graduate level work.’ It was the proudest moment of my life. It’s only been sixteen years, but still. Writing was never my strength. I think back to my crappy little paragraphs about ‘To Kill A Mockingbird’ that I wrote in seventh grade. Even in eighth and ninth grade, my essays were still pretty shit. But I started really working hard to make them better. And I just kinda kept working. And it wasn’t just six months that went into that paper. It was those six years of getting better. And I don’t know if it will get published or anything, that’s probably not something I can do. But for her to say that, it means my work is getting close to what people are actually doing out there in the world. I’m not sure if this makes sense. But it made me feel like I’m finally part of the world. Instead of just in it.”","Photo by Humans of New York on September 22, 2023.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-phx1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/379840077_856717525633269_1322225605775480172_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-phx1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=9hizkDQ1N1cQ7kNvgHMzunV&_nc_gid=540347e9e68a4bee840c2d37e14257b0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAUFarCnw9S_dzvf2PndaRohOba0fN7HCboa3LewReB9Q&oe=6716C578&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3197604082741997260",,,"CxgK_i8LO7M",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxgK_i8LO7M/","Photo by Humans of New York on September 22, 2023.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-phx1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/381123936_133366149858277_5729004020466052078_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-phx1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=X_CfOa6Rr_cQ7kNvgHMmykf&_nc_gid=540347e9e68a4bee840c2d37e14257b0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYApY8HNxwcM9jNKnlb5V3k5CbkDogl2WlGhFollX-U31w&oe=6716DEDB&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3197604082725308912",,,"CxgK_i7Lknw",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxgK_i7Lknw/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2205","720","1080","https://scontent-phx1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/379840077_856717525633269_1322225605775480172_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-phx1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=9hizkDQ1N1cQ7kNvgHMzunV&_nc_gid=540347e9e68a4bee840c2d37e14257b0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAUFarCnw9S_dzvf2PndaRohOba0fN7HCboa3LewReB9Q&oe=6716C578&_nc_sid=10d13b","That's so awesome ❤️you should be super proud 👏nobody is perfect but working that hard paid off and you should have more confidence now....👏","3197604085938025569","https://scontent-phx1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/379840077_856717525633269_1322225605775480172_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-phx1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=9hizkDQ1N1cQ7kNvgHMzunV&_nc_gid=540347e9e68a4bee840c2d37e14257b0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAUFarCnw9S_dzvf2PndaRohOba0fN7HCboa3LewReB9Q&oe=6716C578&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-phx1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/381123936_133366149858277_5729004020466052078_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-phx1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=X_CfOa6Rr_cQ7kNvgHMmykf&_nc_gid=540347e9e68a4bee840c2d37e14257b0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYApY8HNxwcM9jNKnlb5V3k5CbkDogl2WlGhFollX-U31w&oe=6716DEDB&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18057445387830125","0","https://scontent-phx1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/453246767_339045829282612_2667052163870516219_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-phx1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=gT-ZP7-ybKYQ7kNvgEoWytd&_nc_gid=540347e9e68a4bee840c2d37e14257b0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBQT4WDa2Uv2DizPCn3soAfr_xbP7giTVPRikD4k8X1Wg&oe=6716D703&_nc_sid=10d13b","itsyvette2024",,,,,,,,"0","That's so awesome ❤️you should be super proud 👏nobody is perfect but working that hard paid off and you should have more confidence now....👏","2024-10-15T07:06:42.000Z","18018304912785216","2","https://scontent-phx1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/431382768_415088467685831_8474804451718051773_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-phx1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=Dlx9mfL2kZ0Q7kNvgHIneMo&_nc_gid=540347e9e68a4bee840c2d37e14257b0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD0dbqQXnGF8ejhZmN7-fI5ozz3aG_PWF8TKJTwLmP5cA&oe=6716C101&_nc_sid=10d13b","glenyeezy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","I’d love to read her essay","2023-11-30T04:23:00.000Z","18002093354490792","0","https://scontent-phx1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/435450796_439768631947294_1740336050193740665_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-phx1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=61HbvTUjAioQ7kNvgFzzbCd&_nc_gid=540347e9e68a4bee840c2d37e14257b0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYABKFLXt8yI26oJj_wMq1OQeZkntMeXBy-eJ9-uJ8N-Xg&oe=6716E6FC&_nc_sid=10d13b","_jubii",,,,,,,,"0","I connect with this story so much. When I was in undergrad at my advisor (who also was the department chair) said literally the same thing of my 50+ page capstone project — but in Spanish — esto es un trabajo al nivel graduado! We were given a 7-10 page limit, but she always told me I could write as much as I’d like and she’d read it (on every written assignment). She went on to ask me if I’d considered grad school; and to be honest I had no concept of grad school, just “college,” as a first-gen college student. Her encouragement (and insistence) pushed me to apply for a masters program at @uconn, where I was awarded a full tuition scholarship 🤌🏾 One never forgets something like that; I’m sure it influenced and influences my work as an educator!

I wanted the same things for them that I want for all people: to do the next right thing, to say the next true thing. But they were growing up in tough times. So many bad things were being done in the name of Iranians. I wanted them to know the real Iran. I wasn’t able to bring them there, but I did try to build a little Iran around us. I’ve surrounded us with my memories of home. On the wall hangs a painting of Nahavand that I made in Germany. Above the back door hangs the horns of the first ibex I ever hunted. On the shelf in the dining room is my jar of soil. It was collected from a spot in Nahavand at the base of the mountain, right at the source of the spring. And next to my jar of soil, for anyone who needs it: sits my Shahnameh. As soon as they were old enough I asked each of them to memorize a verse about their namesake. Zaal went first. His namesake was one of the wisest heroes in all of Shahnameh: 𝘡𝘢𝘢𝘭 𝘬𝘯𝘦𝘸 𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘴 𝘨𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘴𝘮𝘢𝘭𝘭, 𝘯𝘦𝘢𝘳 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘧𝘢𝘳. 𝘏𝘪𝘴 𝘸𝘪𝘴𝘥𝘰𝘮 𝘴𝘩𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘢𝘴 𝘪𝘧 𝘢 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘳. Rostam went next. He chose from a part of Shahnameh when Iran finds itself in a moment of great darkness. Three enemy kings have aligned their forces. Three hundred thousand men march against us. The army is on the brink of defeat. The dirt’s turned clay with blood. Rostam arrives at the battlefield on foot: no horse, no armor, carrying nothing but a bow and arrow. He walks out to face the enemy alone. And with a single shot, he slays the greatest champion on the other side. The enemy is stunned into silence. Their courage flees them. Their commander screams: 𝘞𝘩𝘰 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘴𝘦 𝘗𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘪𝘢𝘯𝘴? 𝘕𝘰𝘵 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘯 𝘢 𝘭𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘭𝘥 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘢𝘨𝘢𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘮! It’s one of my favorite verses in all of Shahnameh. My entire life, ever since I was a little boy, those have always been my favorite scenes. The ones that make me most emotional. The ones that make my voice break. When at the moment of greatest darkness, one champion makes a stand. And with a single act of courage reveals the soul of an entire people.”","Photo by Humans of New York on September 15, 2023. 未提供相片說明。.","","0","720","1080","https://instagram.ftpe7-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/379314201_993147688473042_4163818395880616979_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftpe7-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=Q_iRYHNiqoMQ7kNvgHlW61-&_nc_gid=4e495f07579b4d4da5b694240b52303a&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCJ_rfqT-AWHJDToIjI5DLmtrcHVVbOi5u0eL-L2Gx-0Q&oe=6716C323&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3192549889698992410",,,"CxONzW3OJEa",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxONzW3OJEa/","Photo by Humans of New York on September 15, 2023. 未提供相片說明。.","","0","720","1080","https://instagram.ftpe7-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/378944811_1254724951909497_716757719097111801_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftpe7-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=xQp8lkzglT8Q7kNvgEAovOM&_nc_gid=4e495f07579b4d4da5b694240b52303a&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC3cuLsqJmGP9iymATot8XJQS0lcux4AuBVIVDgPwv3sA&oe=6716CAA2&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3192549889682271033",,,"CxONzW2OWs5",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxONzW2OWs5/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"106","720","1080","https://instagram.ftpe7-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/379314201_993147688473042_4163818395880616979_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftpe7-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=Q_iRYHNiqoMQ7kNvgHlW61-&_nc_gid=4e495f07579b4d4da5b694240b52303a&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCJ_rfqT-AWHJDToIjI5DLmtrcHVVbOi5u0eL-L2Gx-0Q&oe=6716C323&_nc_sid=10d13b","1001 nights","3192549894002501086","https://instagram.ftpe7-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/379314201_993147688473042_4163818395880616979_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftpe7-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=Q_iRYHNiqoMQ7kNvgHlW61-&_nc_gid=4e495f07579b4d4da5b694240b52303a&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCJ_rfqT-AWHJDToIjI5DLmtrcHVVbOi5u0eL-L2Gx-0Q&oe=6716C323&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://instagram.ftpe7-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/378944811_1254724951909497_716757719097111801_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftpe7-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=xQp8lkzglT8Q7kNvgEAovOM&_nc_gid=4e495f07579b4d4da5b694240b52303a&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC3cuLsqJmGP9iymATot8XJQS0lcux4AuBVIVDgPwv3sA&oe=6716CAA2&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17886041564961483","0","https://instagram.ftpe7-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/435259518_1858588911247415_267693184104790522_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.ftpe7-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=XMqq5QDRXy8Q7kNvgGpfyRd&_nc_gid=4e495f07579b4d4da5b694240b52303a&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYClE5Hn5F-vwam1vX2L28RXbjiZZuwAk-c_KBYW0ap0_A&oe=6716EE39&_nc_sid=10d13b","jessica2024nyork",,,,,,,,"0","1001 nights","2024-04-03T23:51:21.000Z","18210936721265606","0","https://instagram.ftpe7-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/432957661_333902989176141_3885135002458841643_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.ftpe7-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=ycV6FKFDFW8Q7kNvgEswchR&_nc_gid=4e495f07579b4d4da5b694240b52303a&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBBKXrPQcr0vGmxQHxmRfGZVb_rhoASdIHC06ypTciqJg&oe=6716CB5C&_nc_sid=10d13b","skull.loverr",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","درود بر شما ❤️","2023-10-30T11:08:16.000Z","18022680115664694","0","https://instagram.ftpe7-4.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/326260099_1522490344923569_6749849748391225637_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.ftpe7-4.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=NkELqv-9ZgEQ7kNvgGvwoiT&_nc_gid=4e495f07579b4d4da5b694240b52303a&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBZ-kvZOUF9fkW1lRm0nYjB4ls-aH5RYbDZfkHbGKQH_g&oe=6716D5E7&_nc_sid=10d13b","elham.z96",,,,,,,,"0","آفرین که نوه ها را با عشق به شاهنامه و زبان و سرزمینشان پروردید 👏👏👏","2023-09-21T00:27:14.000Z","17971790576385844","0","https://instagram.ftpe7-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/441432404_2934454906692717_3287324773929955778_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.ftpe7-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=9S9pC11_Pa4Q7kNvgGDQS6A&_nc_gid=4e495f07579b4d4da5b694240b52303a&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDeZRRIe9hcIAqKkB_qBxW1lyEZglqmHIO_w2DmQ3Shxw&oe=6716C210&_nc_sid=10d13b","whatdsthefoxsay",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","The translation from Farsi is really so much better than American English imo","2023-09-18T02:53:05.000Z","18127029694311770","0","https://instagram.ftpe7-4.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/107395656_318325456236451_6339977142205596142_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.ftpe7-4.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=4ktJOh9XsjEQ7kNvgHkwTC_&_nc_gid=4e495f07579b4d4da5b694240b52303a&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBSNDiFI9a8Gh4TDBUAkruf3LgtLtBWaDSjay8gkeAkcA&oe=6716D014&_nc_sid=10d13b","anamihajlovic_","0","This is how I feel about Serbia.

First came Ahang’s son Sepanta. Then when I turned sixty we moved into Maziar’s house to help raise his newborn twin boys. And that’s where we’ve been for the last thirty years. The year that we moved in Mitra made me swear an oath. She made me promise that I would die before her, because she couldn’t stand the thought of me being with another woman. Maziar and his wife were doing their medical residency at the time, so most nights we were on our own. Because of Mitra’s hand injury, much of the childcare fell to me. I’d be up all night with one baby in each arm: this one needs a bottle, that one needs a diaper change. When the boys grew a bit older Mitra took over the clothing decisions. She was determined for them to have matching bathrobes. She couldn’t find the exact ones she wanted in America, so she ordered fancy bathrobes from Europe. I was responsible for the physical activities: the wrestling, the hiking, the fishing. In our backyard we built a small garden, and in their quieter moments they would help me tend it. But my most important job was teaching them our language. The vessel of our culture. I wanted to lead them to the source of the spring, so that they could read the words our writers have written. And sing the songs our singers have sung. The Persian alphabet can be difficult, so I didn’t start with letters. I started with words. I chose three hundred words. Simple words, words that everyone should know: 𝘔𝘦𝘩𝘳. Love. 𝘙𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘪. Truth. 𝘕𝘦𝘦𝘬𝘪. Goodness. While we were working in the garden, I’d say them over and over. It didn’t matter to me if anyone was listening or paying attention. All that mattered was that the words were being spoken. Every time we took a long trip in the car, I’d prompt them with the same question: What are the two things that God has given everyone? 𝘑𝘢𝘢𝘯 and 𝘒𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘥.

A guidebook once called Nahavand ‘a piece of heaven, fallen to earth.’ But there’s blood in the soil too. There have been more wars on Iran’s soil than any other country. We’ve had more battles, more bloodshed, more defeats than any other people. And this has been one of the worst of them. The people who stayed in Iran tried their best. But one by one they fell: anyone who stepped out, anyone who spoke up, anyone who said: ‘This is not working for us.’ They were silenced. It was a savage violence. A violence from fourteen hundred years ago. From the moment of those very first executions on the roof of the school, there has been no coherence. No 𝘥𝘢𝘢𝘥. The smallest act could lead to death: a blog post, a sign at a protest, a few strands of hair showing beneath a headscarf. The regime needs fear to stay in control. And for fear to spread, the violence must be random. So that everyone thinks: ‘I could be next. It could happen to me.’ They’ve turned the country into a dark forest. When there is light, when there is law, when there is 𝘥𝘢𝘢𝘥, you know where danger comes from. You can keep away from it. But in the dark danger can come from anywhere, at any time. Parvaneh stayed. The young woman from 𝘕𝘪𝘳𝘰𝘰. The one with the strongest voice. She tried to work for change within the country. In an interview she told a reporter: ‘Iranians abroad can provide spiritual support, but the front must emerge from within Iran.’ She kept writing. She kept speaking out. She kept fighting for political freedom. Only now she was fighting for one-tenth the freedoms that she had before. One night the intelligence services broke into her home. They stabbed her to death, alongside her husband. Dariush was a tall man, much bigger than Parvaneh. But they stabbed her twice as many times. Either they hated her twice as much, or she fought them twice as hard.”","Photo by Humans of New York on September 15, 2023.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 15, 2023.","(46/54) “There was nothing I could do. It was like watching a child fall from the roof of a building. I could only look on in agony. When I arrived in Germany there were two million unemployed. It was years before I could find a job. Resistance takes resources: you must travel, you must speak, you must organize. I just didn’t have the means. I moved into a small apartment with my daughter Ahang, who was already studying in Germany. I’d spend all day listening to the radio for news reports about Iran. I kept hoping that it would be over in an instant. That a dam would break, and everyone would say at the same time: ‘This is not working for us.’ But that moment never came. The grief would not leave me. I wrote poems about Iran. I taught myself to paint, and I painted paintings of Iran. All day I’d pace back and forth in the living room. I’d talk to myself like a madman: ‘How did we fall into this deep pit? How can we get out again?’ I can’t explain it. It’s an irrational love, an illogical love. I don’t know where it comes from. It begins before my memory. There’s so much to love about Iran. It’s so many things: it’s a land, it’s a people, it’s a culture, it’s a story, it’s a myth. But it’s not something you can hold. Through it all, my greatest grief was for Mitra. Less than a month after I left the country, another war started. Iraq invaded Iran, and the borders were closed for four years. Four years without seeing her. She’d write me letters every day. She’d tell me every little thing. One year she sent me a calendar, and she’d written me a love poem from a different poet on every page. Telephones were tough to come by, but she always found a way to call. Mostly we would share news. But we still found time to read each other poetry. It is said that at any given time there are one hundred thousand poets in Iran, and I am not one of them. But in Germany I finally wrote her some poetry of my own: ‘I wish destiny didn’t demand distance / I wish you were here /Your gentle hand caressing my face /Without you, I’m a broken branch / a body without a soul/ a dying flame/ Without you, I’m Rostam with hands bound.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"190","720","1080","https://instagram.fhyw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/378033821_1617641245677268_9010291258681735605_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fhyw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=velU9N0sOREQ7kNvgFVBJUB&_nc_gid=52d8329a196e45f1ab7e1367fc3d4077&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC3YwvhCUy3n3ELbT63SVfICq6SJI7vnUsROzgZGUY3kQ&oe=6716E0D4&_nc_sid=10d13b","عجب شعری… واقعا این یک عمر شعر خواندن هدر نرفته بوده! واقعا شعرتون به قلب آدم نفوذ میکنه، خصوصا بعد خواندن این داستان، درد اون جدایی، درد روزهای دور از وطن بدون وجود همسر رو آدم میتونه حس کنه با خوندنش… احسنت!","3192481595079443218",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17953213955660223","3","https://instagram.fhyw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/283893271_750609302783776_4567484319526486867_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fhyw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=KWKqIfAXC7IQ7kNvgGvNGSd&_nc_gid=52d8329a196e45f1ab7e1367fc3d4077&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAXcHM4RkKIvvNduZ4gtSILn_2v_p-QTZz3xdedUvR5QA&oe=6716E54D&_nc_sid=10d13b","mahtab_mn93",,,,,,,,"0","عجب شعری… واقعا این یک عمر شعر خواندن هدر نرفته بوده! واقعا شعرتون به قلب آدم نفوذ میکنه، خصوصا بعد خواندن این داستان، درد اون جدایی، درد روزهای دور از وطن بدون وجود همسر رو آدم میتونه حس کنه با خوندنش… احسنت!","2023-09-20T06:22:35.000Z","17996055005183360","1","https://instagram.fhyw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/176649930_478535193469836_4561865066952041758_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fhyw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=vuFblXx7yewQ7kNvgEAaG-d&_nc_gid=52d8329a196e45f1ab7e1367fc3d4077&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBj1wWQgfAhiyM079YTVFFu5E4DgFOBfnZhdjzgajlF5g&oe=6716E76F&_nc_sid=10d13b","shi.ma.sa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","من از دیدن این تصاویر و خواندن این زندگینامه زیبا سیر نمیشوم! چقدر سرشار از عشقید! چقدر نورید! چقدر ستودنی! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🩷🩷🩷","2023-09-18T08:55:21.000Z","17852168712044951","1","https://instagram.fhyw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/243356149_587386932503771_2941357887002159625_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fhyw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=QWhK2ILkYCIQ7kNvgH5_zi2&_nc_gid=52d8329a196e45f1ab7e1367fc3d4077&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCMCQmmOBB51Mr8bkzlxXmkl1gufR-42VNaNOYjy2FAzw&oe=6716B978&_nc_sid=10d13b","_arete__",,,,,,,,"0","literally sobbing","2023-09-18T05:49:24.000Z","17862320135988811","1","https://instagram.fhyw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/368370240_1352565152276299_6702486753851762266_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fhyw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=yDhVgVL0u4UQ7kNvgEK2HIS&_nc_gid=52d8329a196e45f1ab7e1367fc3d4077&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDjJCVJBNZOZ9MQEn_pk6DD0m8_6ztqu41OdWHn0Nd2Xg&oe=6716D570&_nc_sid=10d13b","hrrhodes14",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","😢😢😢😢","2023-09-18T01:16:28.000Z","18029325070612111","1","https://instagram.fhyw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/273755389_681404459529354_4840049201758164832_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fhyw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=SbfGfCYFE84Q7kNvgF-1B_Q&_nc_gid=52d8329a196e45f1ab7e1367fc3d4077&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDuenkUeih5Oq6NNjV8ymAPrGjNyh-FH-JBrBUolT6_sQ&oe=6716C563&_nc_sid=10d13b","uruf.r.zarrinkamar","0","تا باد چنین بادا","2023-09-17T16:41:32.000Z","18095331970360119","0","https://instagram.fhyw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/352816135_252988100748918_7815537157677801386_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fhyw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=QJA0MunRTtIQ7kNvgH3rHxX&_nc_gid=52d8329a196e45f1ab7e1367fc3d4077&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCLpO0qiZsbqr1s3GI3pIUYiF686_WhXA_YdRq7p4bTjA&oe=6716E0AB&_nc_sid=10d13b","mallo_colorado",,,,,,,,"0","People have to understand that the time never came when collectively because “it IS working for a lot of people.”🤷‍♀️","2023-09-17T12:40:54.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"30897",,,,,,,,,,"Humans of New York","242598499","humansofny",,"CxN-RiirsMS","2023-09-15T15:58:04.000Z","Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxN-RiirsMS/",,,,

The Iran of our mothers and fathers. The Iran that I had loved since I was a little boy—it was no use to them. They didn’t care about our culture, our history, our ideals. One day Khomeini gave a speech saying that nationalism was against Islam. He said that we should be a nation of Muslims, not a nation of Iranians. The Lion and the Sun were removed from our flag, two of the oldest symbols of Iran. They were replaced by Arabic writing. Our institutions were dismantled one-by-one, until the only things left of the republic and constitution were their names. They became empty boxes that no one knew what was inside. Three months after the revolution I took one final trip to Nahavand. These were the people who trusted me most. Nobody could say that I’d ever wronged them. I wanted to speak with them freely, and share my thoughts. I wanted to see if they grieved along with me. Normally the moment that my car pulled into town, the news would spread like wildfire. People would gather at the house of my father. It had a very large salon, and people would come and go as they pleased. They’d come in excited, passionate, sometimes angry. They’d be critical. They’d debate me. Everyone had something to say. But this time only a small crowd gathered. And I was the only one who spoke. I shared all of my concerns: that we were losing our ideals. We were losing 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥. We were losing 𝘕𝘦𝘦𝘬𝘪. We were losing 𝘙𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘪. We were losing 𝘈𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘪. But everyone just listened in silence. They knew my words were true. They knew better than me. But it was fear. They were silenced by fear. There is a famous parable about a caravan of one hundred merchants crossing the desert. Their camels are loaded down with riches. In the night they are overtaken by two bandits, and robbed of everything. Afterwards they are asked: ‘How could it possibly happen? There were one hundred of you, but only two of them.’ They replied: ‘Yes. But those two were together. And we were alone.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"125","719","1080","https://instagram.fgba1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/377734997_701720612008864_8855621422689290694_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fgba1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=EHVQu8NAbVgQ7kNvgGe40tY&_nc_gid=52253cccb11f496eba19ae6f3b405a4b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAh9sXOghLQ0cEFSuZJrCYLv9wrKcdNeGTxKzFJdSEjIw&oe=6716CA15&_nc_sid=10d13b","When religion becomes an instrument of power and subjugation, it becomes an abomination.","3191895918617633800",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18230057572240172","1","https://instagram.fgba1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/15535260_610278489173958_2400243203514040320_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fgba1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=liOPYh0Hl90Q7kNvgFl3Xlj&_nc_gid=52253cccb11f496eba19ae6f3b405a4b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDrmuZvKkq-fL0yVbdS9Ugv_Y_zmlDfWyvaUfIDLCvc5A&oe=6716D609&_nc_sid=10d13b","gloriam_vanine",,,,,,,,"0","When religion becomes an instrument of power and subjugation, it becomes an abomination.","2023-09-17T22:11:07.000Z","18022530820677435","1","https://instagram.fgba1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/362989330_967271397942395_1600769233768631447_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fgba1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=jOR57fX4ovUQ7kNvgHR7GdF&_nc_gid=52253cccb11f496eba19ae6f3b405a4b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAE942pMPX0242c9TbQkCSbSWCpNBFQ6ZXND57YBl2rKg&oe=6716C73E&_nc_sid=10d13b","gemini132",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","As a child I‘ve heard a thousand times these stories from my father.they were alone und mullahs had the power.I was scared of these big black hijabi women all my childhood.these men with ugly beards,that they would take away my parents and i would never see them again.I learned,what they taught us in schools were wrong but i should keep my tongue for my sake.I think my parents were scared as well!for me and my sister,for our future,for our beliefs,for what we learn and should not learn.my father had suffered severe depression for years,he had lost lots of friends in these tragic ways.","2023-09-17T06:19:30.000Z","17970565310409421","1","https://instagram.fgba1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/251551138_872157233466808_8827185252379183629_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fgba1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=KiSvliYcOdsQ7kNvgF7r1ZL&_nc_gid=52253cccb11f496eba19ae6f3b405a4b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDwv21VY57xqopbhcCSTpMF3AdTCxLae0xtOxtqbCVoIw&oe=6716BEF5&_nc_sid=10d13b","elhaam1981",,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2023-09-17T01:28:00.000Z","18028210828615088","3","https://instagram.fgba1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/437595425_1581980172647969_8070543917149846348_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fgba1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=hc0Rm4TFnuEQ7kNvgGGZjRk&_nc_gid=52253cccb11f496eba19ae6f3b405a4b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB9DN4td3GUS4kvefocIMsrmjgx6_eXsHwIZxJiHVqReQ&oe=6716C9BB&_nc_sid=10d13b","karacaburcak",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","All religious fanatics are the same!

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 14, 2023.","(34/54) “The revolution officially ended on February 11th, 1979. The military announced that they would no longer resist, and Khomeini’s forces took control of the weapons. That morning a bullet came through our window and landed in the wall above our bed. The country became like a house in an earthquake. Everything was scattered and there was nowhere to hide. The streets were barricaded with big bags of sand. Behind them were men holding automatic weapons. The executions began on the roof of the same school building where we had met. First the generals were executed. A few days later it was the Prime Minister. Then several powerful members of parliament. Khomeini would walk out afterward to inspect the bodies. Our house was next to the prison where former members of the king’s government were being held. Every morning we’d wake to the sound of the firing squads. Gordafarid was ten years old at the time. She was scared by all the gunfire, so at night I’d read to her the story of her namesake: Gordafarid from Shahnameh. When the men refused to fight, Gordafarid tied her hair beneath her helmet. She loaded an arrow into her bow. And she rode out from the castle to face the enemy alone. She stopped just short of the enemy lines, and she roared. She roared like thunder! ‘Where are your champions? Who would dare to fight me?’ Only the enemy commander had the nerve to answer her challenge. With fury they fought. The battle burned, the rain of arrows, the spark of swords. Neither champion could strike a fatal blow. Then in the heat of the battle Gordafarid’s helmet was knocked to the ground. Her face shone like the moon. And her hair, her hair was worthy of a crown. The commander was stunned. A woman! It was a woman!

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 14, 2023.","(39/54) “It would have been suicide to fight. There were no courts to petition. No laws to challenge. The only weapon that we had left were our words. I joined together with five colleagues from the Pan-Iranist party, and we formed an underground journal. We met daily in an abandoned office. We wrote with pen and paper, and when each issue was finished it would be secretly printed by a friend that worked at a publishing house. I wrote under the name of Rahdmard. It was the same name Mitra and I would later give to our fourth child, who was born severely disabled. It means a man who is noble. A man who is morally upright. It’s what I wanted for him, and it’s what I wanted for myself as well. In my articles I never attacked the regime directly. I didn’t mention the executions. I never named any names. Instead I wrote about ideals and principles. 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥. 𝘙𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘪. 𝘈𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘪. I said: ‘Let us not lose ourselves. Let us not descend back into darkness.’ We had no idea if our words were being read. Each issue would only be one thousand copies, and we’d only pass them out amongst our friends. But we were like a dying person who was desperate to live. If we wanted to survive, these were the breaths we had to take. Just being together gave us hope. Darkness was pressing in all around us. But coming together for a single purpose, a single goal—it gave our hearts energy. Each day we’d share the news we’d seen and heard. We talked about what we could do, how we could help. One of the members had been sheltering Dr. Ameli at his house. He’d been staying there since the first days of the revolution. But after several weeks he began to miss his wife and family. So he decided to leave the safehouse. He knew that he was innocent, so he took a chance. He went back home. And that’s where they grabbed him.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"80","720","1080","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377895040_2256364977890048_3546860808361234453_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=S0j0sahgCesQ7kNvgEzNIYe&_nc_gid=fe9f8af41cc644de9746e5721c1a13de&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCO-SSbPGtJJCHOd2n10vcPHhqC4lvVfFHsR-qLbdcbTg&oe=6716B8E4&_nc_sid=10d13b","استاد چقدر خوبه که مینویسید 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻","3191923636432402548",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18018749299777008","1","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/450365529_455761910576672_1720176463224935700_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=TWQKprx0LzQQ7kNvgFob1wu&_nc_gid=fe9f8af41cc644de9746e5721c1a13de&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAubF49Z-pof7Vzm5vOEU1TUzy1GYrS2iQFBCb-TKZwRg&oe=6716E3BB&_nc_sid=10d13b","shshiirrin",,,,,,,,"0","استاد چقدر خوبه که مینویسید 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻","2023-09-17T21:09:21.000Z","17970810020405655","1","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/251551138_872157233466808_8827185252379183629_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=KiSvliYcOdsQ7kNvgEf1_Kd&_nc_gid=fe9f8af41cc644de9746e5721c1a13de&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD3emMtYLFtWAY5M7fHkd8tSliFiaQsWCcqJzNlcjWkCg&oe=6716BEF5&_nc_sid=10d13b","elhaam1981",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2023-09-17T01:30:13.000Z","18063586963428990","1","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/309906558_418243200442462_7164101239449108206_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=SERFaGSfd68Q7kNvgEFrZSB&_nc_gid=fe9f8af41cc644de9746e5721c1a13de&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAhBJgGmYUosA3uXUHyiWhHG4x44aDR8xTnUXoD3ayS5Q&oe=6716DA67&_nc_sid=10d13b","seashellwells",,,,,,,,"0","🙌❤️🙌","2023-09-16T21:58:37.000Z","18383306764054601","1","https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/452268016_801513355515435_591503649916053260_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=PTZpXOvsjV0Q7kNvgFLQyEj&_nc_gid=fe9f8af41cc644de9746e5721c1a13de&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB_mG3utqG1u8zD7zXSxKUOJStJxPOOKjZ6KtD7YXqvuw&oe=6716BDC1&_nc_sid=10d13b","i.am.ossie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","This needs a book.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 14, 2023.","(33/54) “On the day Khomeini’s plane landed the road from the airport was lined with hundreds of thousands of cheering people. I hadn’t completely lost hope. The king was gone. But we still had a government, a parliament, a constitution. The only thing new was this man. Maybe he’d been telling the truth. Maybe he truly did want an open society. Khomeini had surrounded himself with liberal advisors. Maybe he’d allow them to run the country. Maybe he’d go to Qom and study his books. The parliament decided to form a small delegation to meet with him; to find out his plans. Since I’d been such a vocal member of the opposition, it was decided that I should go along. Khomeini had taken up residence in a school building directly behind the parliament. When we arrived we were escorted into an empty classroom. There was no furniture. Pillows and blankets were piled against the wall; it was clear that people had been sleeping there. After five minutes Khomeini entered the room. He was dressed all in black. After he took his seat we explained that we were hoping for a peaceful transition of power. One that kept the constitution intact, and the parliament in place. We presented a list of ministers that we thought he would approve. He listened in silence. At no point did he ask a question. At no point did he give a response. It was clear that he had no need for our participation. Power was in his hands. When we finished making our proposal, he asked us to deliver two messages.

He’d been executed four weeks earlier. It was an office I’d been to many times before. But everything beautiful had been removed: the paintings, the carpets, the furniture. In the center of the room was a single table, and at its head sat one of the leaders of the Revolutionary Council. It was the body ultimately responsible for deciding the fate of the regime’s enemies. My colleague groveled. He read a prepared statement. He thanked the man for his wisdom. He thanked him for allowing us to keep our salaries. Then when he finished his remarks, he motioned to me and said: ‘My colleague would like to say something.’ I was caught by surprise. I had nothing prepared. I could have just thanked the man. But when an injustice has been committed, I must speak. It’s part of my code. It’s something I hold as dear as my own spirit. Because if we don’t live our ideals—then they don’t exist. 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥. 𝘕𝘦𝘦𝘬𝘪. 𝘙𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘪. Justice, Goodness, Truth. They depend on us. We are the ones who must make them real. They only exist when we are living them. Truth is not some abstract concept. Truth is something you say. Truth is something you do. No matter how great the fear, you must follow your code. You must stay true to your ideals. Because if you do not, that fear will stay with you. It will break you. Every day it will remind you: you weren’t who you thought you were. And I’m not ready to lose the rest of my life to a single moment. There was a burnt match lying on the floor next to my foot. I picked it up off the ground. I looked the man in the eye, and I told him: ‘Maybe you should be thanking us, for not allowing this injustice.’ Then I held the burnt match in front of my face. ‘Even if you’d asked,’ I told him. ‘I wouldn’t have given you this burnt match.’”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"205","720","1080","https://instagram.flyp2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/377669833_1465219250983019_5364031328006900402_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.flyp2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=qkudvQ4_K8gQ7kNvgHRqoVw&_nc_gid=b2089827083341608b57b43a6835b071&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAeqxZUqybiJX-JT5WzVfdw--KlgPN_ZTYxYV1DLr9vqQ&oe=6716D747&_nc_sid=10d13b","Supeer sir","3191870627652366877",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18391731928034373","0","https://instagram.flyp2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/461322257_1531938641026286_6730750643080494713_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.flyp2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=--NDz0cfai4Q7kNvgGFmK2i&_nc_gid=b2089827083341608b57b43a6835b071&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDDQvapb_0JPGSMiiISxGaxBZCNwzKWqE3IvrQ5AUMTig&oe=6716C25C&_nc_sid=10d13b","smarty__ismael",,,,,,,,"0","Supeer sir","2023-10-22T07:16:37.000Z","18396252298037007","0","https://instagram.flyp2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/44884218_345707102882519_2446069589734326272_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.flyp2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=CWrd8f4xNJwQ7kNvgF773Kn&_nc_gid=b2089827083341608b57b43a6835b071&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=YW5vbnltb3VzX3Byb2ZpbGVfcGlj.3-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYCuGBYDh4lU_b0r34QKoNMiNtz158Ek6ZwmMU0ZDrBrbA&oe=6716D24F&_nc_sid=10d13b","123_singhaisha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Convert it to hindi too please","2023-10-05T12:07:13.000Z","17997113063175222","0","https://instagram.flyp2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/96115434_601305934069786_4041053480910061568_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.flyp2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=7qD5aQbQcu0Q7kNvgFvK4SS&_nc_gid=b2089827083341608b57b43a6835b071&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC2u6IAFTy1OwEO7TLbSmRMzoKpQenM8uUiTnCfasBukQ&oe=6716EB97&_nc_sid=10d13b","pocketfulofyoga",,,,,,,,"0","I'm deeply appreciative of the fact that this brave courageous man FINALLY got to tell his story, thanks to H.O.N.Y💯","2023-09-24T07:19:21.000Z","18007503643815867","0","https://instagram.flyp2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/292301765_182326490883105_4990133029488623774_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.flyp2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=2EAlpihM9McQ7kNvgEJYtPv&_nc_gid=b2089827083341608b57b43a6835b071&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAJNs8TZuVzb_J_HrcPqksKpSe0_sSD3NqRg0NOZmVLZw&oe=6716EED7&_nc_sid=10d13b","goatkisser",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","🙌🔥","2023-09-18T21:11:05.000Z","17849498013037535","0","https://instagram.flyp2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/15253248_182734882191123_8030289920855638016_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.flyp2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=o_bFVGp8VmEQ7kNvgFL4BNx&_nc_gid=b2089827083341608b57b43a6835b071&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCl2CueoFCd26NqAHX6K-s9vMScG1Yt230vZXpxdsX6UQ&oe=6716CD2F&_nc_sid=10d13b","ninifrazz","0","This man is a giant!","2023-09-17T22:48:19.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"24587",,,,,,,,,,"Humans of New York","242598499","humansofny",,"CxLzWyyOPId","2023-09-14T19:44:11.000Z","Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxLzWyyOPId/",,,,
"Photo by Humans of New York on September 15, 2023.","(44/54) “On my final morning in Iran I woke with the sun. I knelt to the ground and prayed. It was a six mile walk to the border. The road climbed through the mountains, the same mountains that ran through Nahavand. But in Nahavand the trees were green. Here there was no life. Ferdowsi once wrote: ‘You cannot escape what is written.’ I’ve always hated that quote. There’s always a choice to be made. Just do the next right thing. That’s what I’ve always believed. Do the next right thing, say the next true thing, and a path will open up. A way will appear. I thought that we could get there. I thought that we, as a people, were going to get there. Every day we would take a step closer: more jobs, more hospitals, more schools. If only we kept choosing the next right thing, we could get there. We could build a new Iran around us. In the end light would win, as Ferdowsi writes: ‘The universe bends toward goodness.’ But you must never underestimate the forces of darkness. They can be victorious for a long time. Years. Decades. Lifetimes. Ferdowsi worked for thirty-three years. Seven verses a day. In the name of the God of Soul and Wisdom. But when he finished no one cared. Iran had been invaded once again, this time by the Turks. No one took the time to read his words. He died a broken man. Nobody heard the story of his life. Nobody heard the story of his death. He wasn’t even given a proper burial. The local cleric wouldn’t allow him to be buried in an Islamic cemetery, so they buried him in his garden. But he died with hope. Because he knew. He knew that no matter how deep they are buried, some words have wings. At the end of Shahnameh, Ferdowsi wrote: “I shall not die. These seeds I’ve sown will save my name and memory from the grave.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"137","720","1080","https://instagram.fktm14-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/378033820_2382502385261993_9144042783388274245_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fktm14-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=3DmsOgPCCRkQ7kNvgHRF-b4&_nc_gid=b4d29e9ec48341fbaca53c72d181b3dc&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAwnK-dtVfWTfZY-rDiOYXhKj1u64Z-fGcTvGWz6QgcBg&oe=6716EC0A&_nc_sid=10d13b","My grandpa could not read, he never went to school to learn but he memorized Shahnameh's stories and he red the verses to me and my little brother from his mind.

There was one parliamentarian who fled to the mountains and died fighting. Even with one eye, I was still a good shot. I could have made a stand. But if I gave my life, it would have to be in exchange for something. Thousands of people were dying at the time, and nothing was changing. The clerics only grew more powerful. The same slogans were being chanted in the streets. Our freedoms continued to be taken away. And then there was Mitra and the children. I couldn’t leave them behind. But with each week came more bad news: another colleague killed, another one arrested. My friends started encouraging me to leave the country, but I wouldn’t consider it. I had promised myself when I came home from Germany that I’d never leave Iran again. But even if I had wanted to, it wasn’t possible. I didn’t have a passport. I was on a list of people who were not allowed to leave the country. One afternoon we received a visit from a former colleague. He sat Mitra and I down in the living room, and he told us that he’d discovered a way to leave Iran through the Turkish border. There was a powerful family there that was known to oppose the regime. He said that the checkpoints weren’t stopping cars with families. So if Mitra rode to the border with me, I’d be able to walk the rest of the way on foot. He turned to Mitra, and said: ‘This is his final chance. If he is killed, never say that his friends abandoned him. We’ve done everything we can to convince him, so now it’s up to you.’ When he was finished, Mitra turned to me and said: ‘You must go.’ And Mitra’s word is law. We set out early in the morning. It was an eight-hour drive to the Turkish border. The entire ride was spent in silence. She kept her emotions hidden. I was a tsunami of tears. We kissed goodbye in Salmas. There was a statue of Ferdowsi in the main square.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"224","720","1080","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/378952067_855282562353715_3187305862641683222_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=WacJjHi-8FoQ7kNvgEX5zaK&_nc_gid=6264b9a9386243c78d011129f073fd19&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAQx4qT8qiLqqRdf5aSOG3b3tQdh2wCG60uJRfLpJxh1w&oe=6716CDC6&_nc_sid=10d13b","Very touching","3192013461797719835",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17990797676120655","1","https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/448144149_1143678720220367_2424524276226317020_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=3yxDBMdCv-gQ7kNvgHxAd8U&_nc_gid=6264b9a9386243c78d011129f073fd19&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBaSzlhylwG6Q8V7IqG1gzM4nysQFIFEO_byZrBxKVV3Q&oe=6716CA0F&_nc_sid=10d13b","nelsroof",,,,,,,,"0","Very touching","2023-10-02T21:17:24.000Z","18024253288714529","1","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/251551138_872157233466808_8827185252379183629_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=KiSvliYcOdsQ7kNvgF_6q6b&_nc_gid=6264b9a9386243c78d011129f073fd19&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCa-HS1FC5CICWGF3aH-fIDdUC7nxLwHUj_Ug-lLfqJaA&oe=6716BEF5&_nc_sid=10d13b","elhaam1981",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2023-09-17T01:38:42.000Z","18021972220674212","4","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/377700843_6273681572741601_1591123095845320080_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=4ruzCvPQVfwQ7kNvgHw5m9Q&_nc_gid=6264b9a9386243c78d011129f073fd19&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA9uW_8Qus54AFA8d29BbWV2sY1mAZGOI-yHa8M9hQtrA&oe=6716EF08&_nc_sid=10d13b","monmahdi",,,,,,,,"0","The story of hundreds of thousands of Iranians. Each of us have family members who were executed (mine for their religious beliefs) and many more who endured this same escape journey through Turkey and Pakistan, risking their lives and being forced to put their trust in the hands of smugglers to cross the borders. My uncle and cousins were merely teenagers at that time, and as Baha’is were specifically targeted by the regime. Can’t even imagine the horrors they faced in Iran, for them to risk the harrowing journey to safety. My uncle left at the age of 16 not knowing another language or having any money or person abroad to help him start new, and only got to see his parents again twenty years later as Bahai’s weren’t allowed passports to travel abroad for a very long time and he wasn’t able to return fearing arrest.

Then there’d be a round of single shots, to make sure the prisoners were dead. I’d lay in bed and count them. When the newspaper arrived later that morning, I’d search for his name among the killed. I was so angry with him. He’d been so careless. On the day he decided to leave the safehouse, he had even made a joke. He’d said: ‘If they arrest me, we’ll all go to court and have a good laugh.’ He knew that he’d done nothing wrong. His entire career, he had been the model of integrity. He thought that his innocence would be enough. He thought: ‘What is true, will be true for everyone.’ But in this system there was no 𝘳𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘪. There was no 𝘥𝘢𝘢𝘥. It was one set of rules for believers, and another set of rules for nonbelievers. I watched some of the show trials on television, to see if I could find him. There were no lawyers, no witnesses, nothing. Just a few people with beards. They’d hand down vague sentences like ‘Crimes against God,’ which carried a sentence of death. We tried everything. We looked everywhere, we called everyone, but nobody knew where they’d taken him. Finally we were able to arrange a meeting with one of Iran’s highest ranking religious figures, Ayatollah Shariatmadari.  We visited him at his house and pleaded with him to intercede. We told him: an innocent man has been arrested, one of the most honest men in all of Iran. There must be some justice. There must be some consideration of the truth. The Ayatollah was a good man. A man with 𝘯𝘦𝘦𝘬𝘪. He was a man of faith, rather than a religious man. He listened with concern; we could see the compassion in his eyes. But there was nothing he could do. He’d already fallen out of favor with Khomeini; and a few months later he’d be arrested himself. After that there was no hope.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"106","720","1080","https://instagram.fphl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/377802995_1476936973145282_1368625286512291582_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fphl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=ya7Y-aqQSycQ7kNvgGMnqe9&_nc_gid=7fe35a56642a434ba1e4469488dc2f10&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAcVBOp0--D5nZlojLH-X_3LpzE0IDL_7euB6XThz6fHQ&oe=6716DAF3&_nc_sid=10d13b","“He thought that his innocence would be enough.” That might be the most devastating thing I’ve heard in a long time.","3191946226894352692",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17980478924283233","1","https://instagram.fphl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/90488087_281839216332910_5153829707157864448_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fphl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=pXAXD0xM2SgQ7kNvgHLvAWd&_nc_gid=7fe35a56642a434ba1e4469488dc2f10&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAT5TaPAOsBNE1Aj_IBEbIjLdfYEks1NAkcxDjzIbiTdw&oe=6716C009&_nc_sid=10d13b","nicolelnu",,,,,,,,"0","“He thought that his innocence would be enough.” That might be the most devastating thing I’ve heard in a long time.","2023-09-18T06:27:24.000Z","17973471233362543","2","https://instagram.fphl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/448671123_1170611417407283_88282911464451792_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fphl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=YkQgjon2o8QQ7kNvgENeN0W&_nc_gid=7fe35a56642a434ba1e4469488dc2f10&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC5DvuqdscyIbN78LLwe04z-rU2toYCLj0vZefC4AN0lQ&oe=6716C8D7&_nc_sid=10d13b","msjuliediane",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","@maatlam I'm reading this post today, 4 days after you commented.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 14, 2023.","(35/54) “Every morning we woke to the sound of shots coming from the prison near our house. The executions were always held at dawn. When the newspaper arrived later that morning, it would show the names and photographs of the dead. An atmosphere of fear began to spread across the country. It wasn’t just the killings. It was the news of the killings, the manner of the killings. They were random. They followed no law. Revolutionary tribunals were formed to deal with enemies of the regime, but there was no due process. Sometimes there wouldn’t even be a trial. Khomeini appointed an executioner as one of the judges. A bus would arrive at his court. He’d let one person pass, then hold the next. When the entire bus had been emptied—the people who were held back would be executed. The story spread across the country. When violence is random, when it is undeserved, when there is no 𝘥𝘢𝘢𝘥, everyone begins to think: I could be next. And that’s exactly what the regime wanted. People grew silent. They would only speak their mind inside their homes. One month after the revolution, there was the first protest against the regime. It happened on International Women’s Day. Thousands of women took to the streets to protest the mandatory hijab. They called for the freedom to choose. 𝘈𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘪. They screamed their slogans in the streets. But their words were never heard. The regime had already taken over the media, and the protests weren’t mentioned anywhere. Then came Khomeini’s followers. They fell on the women like savages, beating them with batons. Calling them ‘whores’ and ‘sluts.’ Bystanders looked on in fear. Nobody tried to defend them. No one spoke a word. There was silence.”","Photo by Humans of New York on September 14, 2023.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-atl3-3.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377847281_3660155787548205_5739566937230395071_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-3.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=c2TtVV8a27YQ7kNvgG63R9S&_nc_gid=f4106d4311f14294ab0b8f403c566c3c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDNisNf9GP7PuL0tftBzDxwxQDFIYxpgrEYMqqu_Nol_w&oe=6716C73A&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3191828627142138948",,,"CxLpzmwutxE",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxLpzmwutxE/","Photo by Humans of New York on September 14, 2023.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/375395115_337149045550539_7686504790299201842_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=9aHk_vALl3YQ7kNvgE5iiS0&_nc_gid=f4106d4311f14294ab0b8f403c566c3c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBLC-ymdGhS1fxYUO0M3w0XLNgj9jc5IKnax5u0lJrirw&oe=6716C896&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3191828627058217216",,,"CxLpzmrulEA",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxLpzmrulEA/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"173","720","1080","https://scontent-atl3-3.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377847281_3660155787548205_5739566937230395071_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-3.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=c2TtVV8a27YQ7kNvgG63R9S&_nc_gid=f4106d4311f14294ab0b8f403c566c3c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDNisNf9GP7PuL0tftBzDxwxQDFIYxpgrEYMqqu_Nol_w&oe=6716C73A&_nc_sid=10d13b","How incredibly sad","3191828637334342145","https://scontent-atl3-3.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377847281_3660155787548205_5739566937230395071_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-3.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=c2TtVV8a27YQ7kNvgG63R9S&_nc_gid=f4106d4311f14294ab0b8f403c566c3c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDNisNf9GP7PuL0tftBzDxwxQDFIYxpgrEYMqqu_Nol_w&oe=6716C73A&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/375395115_337149045550539_7686504790299201842_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=9aHk_vALl3YQ7kNvgE5iiS0&_nc_gid=f4106d4311f14294ab0b8f403c566c3c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBLC-ymdGhS1fxYUO0M3w0XLNgj9jc5IKnax5u0lJrirw&oe=6716C896&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18022647955664264","1","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/220383841_575002923663119_20186783678492300_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=VUJwdxA0mb8Q7kNvgFgxjMY&_nc_gid=f4106d4311f14294ab0b8f403c566c3c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC0yP5CvbVQaM_L8FCKPKLcX-fyEKXn777IETf4BWXNfA&oe=6716D503&_nc_sid=10d13b","chrissyisdesigning",,,,,,,,"0","How incredibly sad","2023-09-26T17:19:32.000Z","18001935320028324","1","https://instagram.fthe2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/44884218_345707102882519_2446069589734326272_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e0_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fthe2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=CWrd8f4xNJwQ7kNvgEKUbY9&_nc_gid=e7375f04c21b467697477c01ffbfd6b7&edm=ALWcnLkBAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=YW5vbnltb3VzX3Byb2ZpbGVfcGlj.3-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYBTG53waN9fqm3AicV80poKYzr5Gh1_WaAqZl6Co3nkjQ&oe=6716D24F&_nc_sid=e04f21","mogabobayippi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","This regime has very strategic mental games.

"Photo by Humans of New York on October 02, 2023.","“The person who hurt us, hurt both of us. But it affected us differently. I isolated myself. I started taking drugs when I was twelve, maybe thirteen. But she just moved on with her life. I could never understand: how can she be so happy, while I’m stuck in my head and constantly thinking about it? It was exhausting to me. She was exhausting to me, especially when we were teenagers. I couldn’t stand to be around her because she was so light and positive and funny. Everything was always so cool, and so good. It felt to me that she didn’t want to face it. She just wanted to accept that it happened, and move on. But I couldn’t move on. I didn’t have that choice. I couldn’t just choose to not think about it. I remember the bad things, and how they made me feel. And I never want to feel that way again. I couldn’t just go back out into the world like it never even happened. I know that there are a lot more good people than bad, I do believe that. But there are bad people too. And they can really hurt you deeply if you give them your trust. So I never trusted anyone. Three years ago it reached a point where I felt completely hopeless. It was all so exhausting. I was exhausted. Exhausted from carrying these heavy feelings. Exhausted from making bad decisions. Exhausted from the drugs. It felt like nothing was ever going to change for me. Around that time we went out to dinner with my mother, and we finally had a deep talk about everything. We’d talked about it before, but maybe this time I really meant it. I decided that I have to let it go. I just have to let it go. I still have dark times when I don’t want to study or work. But when I’m in a bad mood, I’ll turn to her. Her happiness doesn’t make me feel worse anymore. It motivates me. It inspires me. Now she’s the person who can most easily put me in a good mood. I let her be a part of my bad days. And because of that, she’s also become a huge part of my good days. Both of us have gotten a lot more mature, and a lot wiser. But it was mainly me, I think. I had to change. If I hadn’t found a way to let go, we’d still be too different to be this close.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"852","720","1080","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/386189527_621476829900133_7698980967301237880_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=Q1P-Z8jF8YcQ7kNvgEHHH3g&_nc_gid=3de1408b5810498da83438d847aa84f8&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCKIz4l7O2rp_yd9eUwd-thtyddcGosBK8E37Lnkem_6w&oe=6716DD1A&_nc_sid=10d13b","I can relate to this story....😢abuse never leaves the mind... memories are always there😢","3204869293074001973",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17898202953080825","0","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/453246767_339045829282612_2667052163870516219_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=gT-ZP7-ybKYQ7kNvgE0W3Pk&_nc_gid=3de1408b5810498da83438d847aa84f8&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBbvgYaXiHh446xoQKwDPOmozHC5qCUAdP7Dwe5Z1wcYA&oe=6716D703&_nc_sid=10d13b","itsyvette2024",,,,,,,,"0","I can relate to this story....😢abuse never leaves the mind... memories are always there😢","2024-10-15T07:23:32.000Z","18063747634657765","0","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/270737791_963836737556248_1171199920242390482_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=1awFobPCMg8Q7kNvgFu5vOO&_nc_gid=3de1408b5810498da83438d847aa84f8&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDj69Bh9QoC3o1Nc7wTEMPI9ffKlXrla6upx09tn_b29g&oe=6716CF61&_nc_sid=10d13b","deidreleigh1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Thanks so much for sharing!!

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 14, 2023.","(36/54) “The religious fanatics were less than ten percent, but you couldn’t tell them apart. They looked like us. They spoke the same language. They did what no invader had been able to do for three thousand years—erase our nation, our culture, our connection to the past. But they did it from the inside. In the beginning things were relaxed. The first Prime Minister was a pious Muslim, but he was an educated man. A thoughtful man. Mitra attended an event where he was speaking, and his wife wasn’t even wearing a hijab. But the clerics slowly worked their way into government. And the more they got power, the more the environment became closed. Cinemas were shut down. Music was banned from television. The poetry of Farrokhzad was banned. It’s not that Mitra promoted Khomeini, but she defended him. She’d say that the king wasn’t innocent either. She said that she liked the hijab. She felt that it was a symbol of modesty, and respect for tradition. At the time I was more religious than Mitra. But I couldn’t make her understand: the problem isn’t Islam. There is nothing wrong with hijab. But there must be 𝘢𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘪. There must be the freedom to choose. I think Mitra only took the other side because she wanted to discourage me from speaking out. She wanted to keep me safe. Dr. Ameli had already gone into hiding. The regime was looking for any reason to go after people. They’d sent agents to Nahavand looking for evidence of corruption, but they could not find a thing. One day Khomeini ordered every member of parliament to pay back their salaries. But my former colleagues in the opposition petitioned for an exemption. They argued that we’d been critical of the king’s policies, and at the last minute an exemption was granted. One of my colleagues requested a meeting with a leader of the Revolutionary Council. He wanted to express his gratitude, and he asked me to come along for support. I didn’t want to do it. I didn’t feel any gratitude at all. I hadn’t done anything wrong. It would have been unjust to take my salary. But he begged me to come. And he promised that I would not need to speak.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"101","720","1080","https://instagram.fosu2-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/378800964_1345087699480156_7780829736940536894_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fosu2-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=yFEUEXL3MdwQ7kNvgFicJXg&_nc_gid=9cec803a6efc415eba488ef59da273e2&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB8j9AkrvX1-5FeOKtDk9Jcvxy4lrnv5ZvlYtvgvxVHUw&oe=6716D26D&_nc_sid=10d13b","خانم ميترا !!!!!!!! دفاع از خمينى؟!!!!!!","3191850636416737803",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17996542292141097","0","https://instagram.fosu2-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/463180217_475667168760923_4880606613281650151_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fosu2-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=FapnPq6JpYAQ7kNvgGniUgN&_nc_gid=9cec803a6efc415eba488ef59da273e2&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCxjSxu-7sNv_xNXEUbPlev6KNVKtNTdmcVMJjn0wXWnw&oe=6716C458&_nc_sid=10d13b","sahrasoleimani",,,,,,,,"0","خانم ميترا !!!!!!!! دفاع از خمينى؟!!!!!!","2023-09-17T23:18:25.000Z","18301771060140878","2","https://instagram.fosu2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/459332621_358228764033043_1692763817368023285_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fosu2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=2RkarvUE7dYQ7kNvgFwxzmh&_nc_gid=9cec803a6efc415eba488ef59da273e2&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDAC3aTga8fTiF5lH4fsee20sPXmCbdGfkhM3rvJNs2eA&oe=6716ED58&_nc_sid=10d13b","teachkizzyteach",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","“But I couldn't make her understand: the problem isn't Islam.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 14, 2023.","(41/54) “Mitra couldn’t sleep without me. On the nights when I came home late, I’d always find her awake listening to tapes. We still read poetry together. Even in the midst of the chaos, even on the darkest nights, even if only for twenty minutes. It was my greatest comfort. The time when I felt most at peace. One of the most famous love stories in all of Shahnameh is the tale of Bijan and Manijeh. It’s a special story. Because it’s the one time in Shahnameh when Ferdowsi reveals a glimpse of his own life. He writes in the chapter’s opening that he has fallen into a great depression. He describes a night so dark that no birds sing. He calls for his wife to join him, and she brings him a candle. She offers to tell him a story, and Ferdowsi agrees to weave it into verse. She tells him the story of Bijan and Manijeh. Bijan is a champion of Iran. Manijeh is the daughter of an enemy king. By chance they meet in the forest, and Manijeh mistakes Bijan for an angel. She falls in love at first sight. She smuggles him back to her palace, and they spend several nights in each other’s arms. Until their love is discovered by the king. He grows so angry that he cries tears of blood. He banishes Manijeh from the palace. And he sentences Bijan to a fate worse than death. Total darkness. Bijan is chained to the bottom of the deepest pit, and a stone is rolled over the entrance. But Manijeh will not allow him to die. She roams the countryside, begging for food. She digs a hole beneath the stone, just large enough to fit her hand. And she keeps Bijan alive. One handful at a time.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"98","720","1080","https://scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/378055795_6521373144582810_3336147582711007624_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=-QrFov3m6-wQ7kNvgHy9ip_&_nc_gid=830ed168549b4929904c44ac0ca22491&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDBPp1EiB87CDLBU8MQ6Fdm_Iz0rP7DGeNTsky2cV3ySA&oe=6716D4E5&_nc_sid=10d13b","I am reading these stories one by one and although it is so painful to read these as an Iranian woman, I cannot help reading them.

That morning I counted more than ever before: twenty-one. When the newspaper arrived that morning, I ran my finger down the list until I found his name. It has always been my belief, that if one of us could have survived, it should have been him. He could have united people. His entire life, all his thoughts, all his words, led back to one thing: our common destiny. When you only fight for one lane, one party, one policy-- all you see is conflict. Unity is so elusive. There is only one thing we all share: Iran. And nobody knew Iran more-- nobody loved Iran more-- than Dr. Ameli. We’d later learn his last words were: ‘Do not think of me, think of Iran.’ He was so brilliant. He could have earned all the money in the world. But that’s not where he stored his treasures. He chose to have less, so he could do more. And that is the rarest kind of person. There should be a statue of him in the center of Tehran. But nobody heard the story of his life. Nobody heard the story of his death. It was a seed that didn’t fall into soil. It was too dangerous to even hold a memorial service. We couldn’t grieve. We couldn’t gather together to share our memories. Our only way to honor him was to keep working, to keep resisting in whatever small way we could. We found an empty conference hall, a place so isolated that no one could hear our voices. And we’d hold meetings late at night. We’d bring in singers with beautiful voices, and they’d sing songs. Songs about loving Iran. And as people were leaving we’d hand out cassettes with the speeches of Dr. Ameli. At the very least we could spread his words. On the cover of the cassette we put a picture of his face, next to The Lion and The Sun. They’re two of the oldest symbols of Iran. The sun, the source of all light. And the lion. The lion is the most powerful animal in Iran. It’s loyal. It would do anything for its tribe. And it doesn’t run from anything.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 15, 2023.","(53/54) “It’s a beautiful word in itself, Mitra. Someone who has no idea of its meaning can appreciate its beauty. Mitra always had a genius for beauty. She knew it completely. She wanted it around her at all times. Even now she keeps a book of Hafez by our bedside. It’s always in reach, and whenever she finds a verse that she loves, she will bring it to me. She still trusts me to find the melody. Poetry is one of the things that she still remembers best. Because poetry is music. It sinks into the memory. Even if you can’t remember a word, the rhythm will guide you. The rhyme will give you a hint. Recently we were reciting a poem from an old book, and one of the words had completely faded. It was a poem that we both used to love. And I was so mad at myself. I kept trying to remember the word, but it would not come to me. Then suddenly she said it. It made me so happy. It doesn’t hurt when she forgets anymore, but it makes me so happy when she remembers. To know that the memory is still inside of her. That she is still holding on. Our lives are just a fistful of memories, ice melting in our hands. And Mitra’s ice is melting faster than mine. But she still has more memories of me than anyone else. And I have a lifetime of memories every time I look at her. And until the last moment, until the last ice has melted, we will still be us. Our entire lives we’ve been on two different roads. But the horizon was always the same. It was an unwritten promise: that no matter what happens, I will keep you. Even when we disagree, I will keep you. From a distance, I will keep you. In the dark, I will keep you. In the deepest pit, I will keep you. Even if you lose your country, even if you lose your eye, even if you lose your memory, I will keep you. We will still be us. It’s the only thing we ever agreed on. We always agreed on us. It’s one of the earliest principles of Iran. It’s where she gets her name. Mitra, the God of Promises.”","Photo by Humans of New York on September 15,

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 13, 2023.","(28/54) “The king loved Iran. And I believed him when he claimed that it was his dream to have a more open society one day. With a truly free press. And truly free elections. But he didn’t think Iran was ready. It was fear. So many foreign powers were trying to control Iran. The country was full of spies. He’d already survived two assassination attempts, and he saw enemies everywhere. I never viewed myself as an enemy of the king. There was only one thing I wanted. It was the same thing I’d wanted since I was a little boy, when I saw him for the first time. When I touched his coat. I wanted him to be a good king. I wanted him to respect the constitution. I wanted him to involve the people, and hear our voice. On the day of his visit I was excited to welcome him to Nahavand. I wanted to show him that we were trusting the people to make their own choices, their own decisions. I arrived early to the airport. The king’s handlers explained how the welcoming ceremony would proceed. I was to stand on the tarmac about fifty meters from where the king’s helicopter was supposed to land. He would speak to me first. And then he would go on to speak to a crowd of dignitaries gathered behind me. I walked out to my assigned spot. I was out there all alone, with a crowd of fifty people watching. I had my quote from Shahnameh ready. It’s from the moment that Rostam welcomes Prince Esfandiyar. He says: ‘𝘉𝘭𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘦𝘥 𝘪𝘴 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘳𝘰𝘯𝘦.

He was a unifying figure. A man without enemies. His words never cut. He attacked philosophies; never people. And he was one of the best speakers in parliament. He didn’t use slogans. He spoke with depth. And somehow, no matter how specific the policy, or how divisive the issue, he always came back to a place of unity. Our common destiny as a people. On the morning our first budget was presented Dr. Ameli approached me in the halls of parliament. He asked if I planned to give a speech. I told him I did not, because I had no specific objections. He leaned close to my ear, and with a soft voice he said: ‘Still, you must speak. To separate yourself from the system.’ That night I slept on a rug on the floor of parliament, and first thing in the morning I placed myself on the calendar of speakers. When my turn came I walked down the aisle toward the podium. My knees felt weak. There is a magnitude to speaking in parliament, a consciousness of history. I’ve never been a natural speaker. I’m never one chosen to give a toast at parties. But if I believe a statement is true, I can say it. No matter how big the stage. Truth has power. Truth has a force. 𝘕𝘪𝘳𝘰𝘰. It doesn’t come from the tongue, it comes from within. And the moment I take my place at the podium: it’s like a spring has been sprung.  That day I spoke about justice. 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥. I said that justice in society begins with justice in our budget. There was a proposal in the budget to build a new telephone system in one of Tehran’s nicest neighborhoods. I reminded the parliament that there were entire villages without a single phone. I said: ‘Before we give the wealthy a phone by every bedside, let us give a phone to every village.’ It was one of the most forceful speeches I’ve ever given. But there was no mention in the media; criticism of the government was not allowed. I at least wanted a copy for my own records. There was a person in parliament who transcribed everything, so I asked them for a copy of my speech. But they told me it was not allowed. They wouldn’t even give me my own words.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"81","720","1080","https://instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/377877140_874970654142196_7873285209299882049_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=fL7AjhERYyAQ7kNvgEZ1iVx&_nc_gid=8b082c578209452fb47b288f63e4e9ce&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAqyJtnFZWLxoqj7tubJUnKsM4zlOHlJ2pj_p37_qRzEQ&oe=6716E6B9&_nc_sid=10d13b","Really need these series to turn into a single novella so I can reread and share.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 13, 2023.","(30/54) “We were at the eighteenth birthday party of our daughter Ahang when we learned that a crowded movie theater had been set on fire in the town of Abadan. The arsonists had locked the exits from the outside, and four hundred people were killed. It was the largest act of terrorism in the history of Iran. Later it would be discovered that the arsonists were religious fanatics. But Khomeini was able to convince much of the country that the fire had been started by SAVAK, at the order of the king. The riots continued to grow. And the king began to panic. He called for the formation of a new government and fired his ministers. He wanted to replace them with upright people. People who could inspire confidence. People who could not be corrupted. And there was one member of parliament that was trusted most of all. He lived in a simple house. He drove a beat-up car. Nobody could question Dr. Ameli’s integrity. The king asked him to join the new administration as Minister of Information. In his new position he would be responsible for investigating the Abadan fire. If he discovered something that implicated Khomeini, I knew he would become a marked man. I drove to his office. I begged him to turn down the position. I told him: ‘Things have become too dangerous. Let’s stay low, let’s keep in our bunker. Once things have calmed down, we can reemerge. We can take a stand and make our case to the people.’ Thirty years earlier we had sworn an oath, to give our lives for Iran. The years had changed him in so many ways. There was white in his hair now. He was a respected leader. He’d written and spoken on every facet of Iran’s society and history. His thoughts had evolved. His policies had evolved. But his ideals had never changed. Every choice he made, he made for Iran. Every choice. He listened politely while I made my case. He knew. Deep in his heart he knew. He knew even better than I did.

For the first time ever, our speeches would now reach the ears of ordinary Iranians. During the first recorded session I gave a speech. I spoke about the same things I always spoke about. I spoke about 𝘥𝘢𝘢𝘥. About every Iranian getting their fair share. I spoke about 𝘢𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘪. About every Iranian having the chance to participate in the future of their country. For the next week our phone at the house rang off the hook. People were calling me to thank me for my words, people I didn’t even know. But by then it was too late. Khomeini had grown too powerful. So much of the country had received their political education in mosques. They viewed him as a savior; they thought a true Islamic revolution was coming. Opposition groups could sense the wave building, and they rushed to align themselves with Khomeini. They thought that they could mix in their own ideology with his views.  They thought they’d be able to ride the dragon’s back, and direct his fire. Even many of the liberal groups were siding with him. Khomeini had been giving interviews. He was telling reporters that he wanted a democracy. He was saying that he would protect the rights of women, and people believed him. He would later claim that Islam allows lying during times of war. One week a rumor spread across the country that Khomeini’s face would be visible in the next full moon. Hundreds of thousands of people went to their rooftops. And hundreds of thousands of people, even educated people, reported seeing his face. On Ramadan nearly a million people marched in Tehran against the king. Our house was on one of Tehran’s main boulevards, so I stood in the doorway to watch the crowd pass. Many were students. They were joyful. They thought that freedom was finally coming to Iran. But the crowd was also filled with young religious men. They were dressed all in black. They would take a few steps, kneel, pray, and then they would rise and do it again. It was like a river, moving in one direction. And Iran was a leaf, floating on top.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"186","720","1080","https://scontent-doh1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/378592613_1642975692780806_1271833272309043573_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-doh1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=3g7ryA2BcZYQ7kNvgH2ppXe&_nc_gid=bafb9be2d34a46f69e8d099421139225&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC5ZKq_i1jgMfUYvOoGUrULg7vX0qz3pou6ckDW4cAjOA&oe=6716E5FB&_nc_sid=10d13b","I will argue that people didnt even know what is freedom and democracy.

Then whatever letter that verse ended with, the other person would think of a verse that began with that letter. We’d go back and forth until someone got stuck. And Mitra could not be beaten. Her memory was a library of Persian poetry. When our children were older she applied to the literature program at the University of Tehran. It was a very selective program, but she received one of the highest possible scores on the admissions test. Some mornings I’d drop her off at school on my way to parliament. She’d have me drop her off down the street, because she didn’t want to be seen with a parliamentarian. The college campuses in Tehran had become a hotbed of political protest. With his White Revolution the king had provided free education to the children of Iran. Now those children were grown, and they wanted a say in the future of their country. Many wanted more freedom. They wanted truly free elections. They wanted an end to censorship, an end to political persecution, an end to SAVAK. Others thought the king had brought too many freedoms to Iran: the capitalism, the tight clothes, the violent movies. It was too much, too fast. They wanted a return to tradition. And Islam became a rallying point. But this was the Islam of our fathers. An Iranian Islam. The Islam of Rumi. The Islam of Hafez. During our next break from Parliament I visited a bookshop. The owner reached beneath his desk and pulled out a book by Khomeini-- the cleric from Qom who had incited the riots in Tehran. Khomeini had been sent into exile by the king, but he still had a large following in the country. His speeches were smuggled into the country on cassettes and sold in the bazaar. In his book he called for an Islamic dictatorship. He talked about returning to ‘the source’ of Islam. Sharia Law. It was an Islam from fourteen hundred years ago. An Islam of cutting off hands, oppression of women, and death for non-believers. He said that ‘Islam provides a law for every aspect of human life.’ But he did not say how the law would be enforced.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 13, 2023.","(24/54) “One afternoon the empress and prince attended a session of parliament. It was an important day. Everyone was hoping to make a strong impression, and I’d prepared a speech especially for the occasion. I was the last speaker on the schedule. The Speaker of Parliament saw me approaching the podium and tried to wave me off. When I kept coming, he hurriedly adjourned the session. I think some of my colleagues viewed me as an annoyance. I’d developed a reputation for speaking my mind. And whenever I could speak, I spoke. I gave a speech on every budget, every proposal, every vote. The topic was always different. But the theme was always the same: 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥. Justice. The word that appears most in Shahnameh. Everyone gets what they deserve. One day I gave a speech saying I’d been informed that Iran’s highest-ranking admiral had used a battleship to import Italian furniture. I asked how we could allow such corruption, from a man with a breast full of public service medals. The crowd was silent. It was unheard of to criticize the military, because it was in the hands of the king. But I wanted to show that I was not afraid to speak. So that other Iranians would feel free to share their thoughts. My words were never heard in the media. If there was ever a mention in the newspaper, it would only say: the representative from Nahavand gave a speech. But still, I spoke. I always had hope that I’d find a way to be heard. There is an Iranian proverb about ‘words that fly.’ It says that if words are false, if they are self-serving, if they come from ambition: they will never fly. Even if they’re shouted from loudspeakers. Even if everyone says them at the exact same time: they will soon be forgotten. For they have no soul. They have no 𝘫𝘢𝘢𝘯. But if a person can find the right words. If the words have 𝘢𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘨, if the words have 𝘬𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘥, if the words have 𝘳𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘪-- they will grow wings. And they will fly. Even if they’re censored; they will fly. Even if they are silenced; they will fly. Even if they are buried deep in the ground; they will still fly. And they will reach the doorstep of every household.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"111","720","1080","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377986899_880797596710475_7769363668010260317_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=LTLlNYiHsOQQ7kNvgF2OW9x&_nc_gid=d8f7dc589569480db38b9b5ff4b4dbad&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAXcWnXT2BV_0HARwTIkjZMF_jRLB7cAX4zW3pMWa93CQ&oe=6716E9E9&_nc_sid=10d13b","The truth shall take flight, so let it fly 🙌","3191126671075517285",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18358772317072192","1","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/426829350_762534352418923_6337516716316565117_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=ZqdT3jgU-VQQ7kNvgFF8_2l&_nc_gid=d8f7dc589569480db38b9b5ff4b4dbad&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBfAV6qli1OxRA9e2Ar39c-N6wGrIMQNAeVY-w6BiGcSg&oe=6716CD45&_nc_sid=10d13b","ginjanbros",,,,,,,,"0","The truth shall take flight, so let it fly 🙌","2023-10-26T14:13:56.000Z","18386433316004571","1","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/458868597_397534826701752_2041092785024533135_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=IOsH8m73t-8Q7kNvgHdPAZ1&_nc_gid=d8f7dc589569480db38b9b5ff4b4dbad&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAOlgXVeLk79MsAH0qFmLLFTUnK6jr8Jf7OfQwj0DbkaQ&oe=6716D654&_nc_sid=10d13b","behnams1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","❤️❤️","2023-09-29T16:19:56.000Z","18193293553287703","1","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/434082467_7717218191631053_8279465412646331359_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=RzY6gcfM-9oQ7kNvgFLa7JH&_nc_gid=d8f7dc589569480db38b9b5ff4b4dbad&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD6D4QpCMoYlkjX6UlaSMb17yB8Sl4EmBVwP00hT4IqhA&oe=6716EE0E&_nc_sid=10d13b","yiannisb89",,,,,,,,"0","Why is there inconsistency between Persian translation and the English version?

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 13, 2023.","(32/54) “In the end the king turned against his own friends. One day a colleague approached me in the halls of parliament. She was married to a former minister, and the king had just thrown her husband in jail to appease the mobs. She asked me what I thought was going to happen. I answered with a quote from Shahnameh: ‘Tomorrow I will calm your fear.’ Even then I still had hope. I thought we still had time to save the country. But those were the end days. On the Friday after Ramadan there was a protest in one of Tehran’s main squares. The army panicked and fired machine guns into the crowd. One hundred people were killed, and that night one hundred fires raged in Tehran.  Strikes began to hit the country. Everything shut down: schools, factories, air travel, even the oil industry. The lifeblood of Iran. The country became like a paralyzed man, gasping for its final breaths. In October the king went on television. It would be his final speech to the Iranian people. By then he was suffering from late-stage cancer. He was a very sick man. He apologized for past mistakes. He said: ‘I am the guardian of a constitutional monarchy, which is a God-given gift. A gift entrusted to the Shah by the people.’ He said that he had finally heard our voice, but it was too late. The people had stopped listening. The king only had one option left. His generals were still loyal. He still controlled the military, and there were half a million men under arms. He could fight. He could hold onto power, but only if he spilled the blood of Iranians. He had a choice. There’s always a choice to be made. Three months later I was listening to Mohsen Pezeshkpour give a speech from the podium of parliament; he was the founder of the Pan-Iranist party. In the middle of his speech, a messenger handed a note across the podium. He read the note, then over the microphone we heard him ask loudly: ‘Where did he go?’ The crowd let out a gasp. We knew then, the king was gone. The flag had fallen. The day was lost. And there’d be no more role for us to play. That’s the problem with absolute power. It’s like a tent with a single pillar. And when you take out that pillar—everything collapses.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"226","719","1080","https://instagram.fmem1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/377705267_756513009821609_2092844933008784549_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fmem1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=L_Uwt8odsIwQ7kNvgF0YnD4&_nc_gid=3f4d4e4276504b539a3f452a59608112&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAdNvSpHxvw_juq8qLjn9j27nGaqDg5xpb7HUSIDu6FEg&oe=6716BB8E&_nc_sid=10d13b","cowords","3191311163484199475",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18009195109902888","0","https://instagram.fmem1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/436333560_786797366761156_4115476778382239611_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fmem1-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=87Ob9ZYRuMMQ7kNvgEDHFvb&_nc_gid=3f4d4e4276504b539a3f452a59608112&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYANWrvsMw2novDvNWislY-1yE_61_t3_XgJqBT-UlzPuA&oe=6716BB83&_nc_sid=10d13b","govindpilla",,,,,,,,"0","cowords","2023-09-18T15:21:45.000Z","18027071026620974","0","https://instagram.fmem1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/337419377_901728247714326_1831442644542873615_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fmem1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=lClml_B39LMQ7kNvgGIt1bo&_nc_gid=3f4d4e4276504b539a3f452a59608112&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDh2Q9y5AA3d5-g4nz0IDjEvJ-x3SZvHtcOw3v3syq6YQ&oe=6716DC26&_nc_sid=10d13b","womenofcyprus",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","The King loved his people so much he would rather leave than kill a single Iranian.

But not Mitra. She was spontaneous, she was funny. Words came from her like light from a lamp. And she could speak to anyone. There were never any formalities. No warm-up. She’d talk to every person as if she’d known them her entire life. We’d go to gatherings with ten or fifteen of our friends; often Dr. Ameli would be there. As soon as Mitra walked in the room the silence would end. At some point in the evening the conversation would always turn to politics. And the moment I began to debate an issue, Mitra would take the other side. She would team up with anyone against me. The person never mattered. The topic never mattered. She never wanted to get me started, so she’d always shut me down. It’s how we’ve been our entire lives. I’ve been the gas, she’s been the brakes. I thought about her every time I wrote a speech. She’s always been my antithesis. The hardest for me to convince. It could sometimes seem like her main purpose in life was to oppose me. To the outside world our love made no sense. We seemed so far apart. But there are many types of closeness. And some the world will never see. We still read poetry together. Mitra still trusted me to find the melody. There was one poem called ‘Sin,’ by Forough Farrokhzad. It scandalized religious society; everyone was talking about it. But it was one of Mitra’s favorites, so I’d memorized the entire thing: “‘I sinned a sin full of pleasure / in an embrace that was warm and eager / I sinned wrapped in arms / hot, hard, and avenging / in that dark and silent seclusion / I knew his secrets / my heart quivered in my breast / in answer to his hungry eyes.’”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"110","720","1080","https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377819742_827821932453904_1746153951224729352_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=MDV9yKs64XoQ7kNvgHJbu90&_nc_gid=82b9baa5eafc44cbb1c9a2d042c5972f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDFJoVzZqFcpAt7e7-gG2HIGHtQ6mqmRpOiRSYu3XI3tw&oe=6716CF01&_nc_sid=10d13b","@instagralls","3191095620970125727",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18021919591850001","0","https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/164467802_480615492970889_5027675702502513239_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=_-zqbYRaRTQQ7kNvgGyPg-0&_nc_gid=82b9baa5eafc44cbb1c9a2d042c5972f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDPvXvurc2398Nveq4PTYJRw45pDjRssFE-hwVfGKUpjw&oe=6716E429&_nc_sid=10d13b","ionlyshitatwork",,,,,,,,"0","@instagralls","2023-11-17T00:09:36.000Z","17909685446752859","1","https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/14269203_330396673964574_1831530558_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=O8npewMCxW8Q7kNvgExd24m&_nc_gid=82b9baa5eafc44cbb1c9a2d042c5972f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAyAqrSufcpiajxywDnV3O0kNG2Jjs107g4erpiKQX6aQ&oe=6716D549&_nc_sid=10d13b","sarahb1514",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","This has been absolutely beautiful to read, thank you","2023-09-18T02:29:32.000Z","17913721967732204","1","https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/458512785_1066369034899652_2257101600556106485_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=Vy-LYhwP4t0Q7kNvgGc4xTH&_nc_gid=82b9baa5eafc44cbb1c9a2d042c5972f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA3wkJsEQOU7V6ew3Rg_csXyR6SJUl-QV6iUm8l1n83aA&oe=6716E421&_nc_sid=10d13b","carobrooksmusic",,,,,,,,"0","Oh my, this one. ❤️","2023-09-18T02:29:21.000Z","17981274743253544","1","https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/160876316_126637999394643_6250643974535247660_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=EZhL_1gK8HQQ7kNvgFg2_D_&_nc_gid=82b9baa5eafc44cbb1c9a2d042c5972f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDetFLFyM4lMFRaL1162tK1M0Agr6WKvMqnu0DhBRImJg&oe=6716CEC9&_nc_sid=10d13b","lady.sun.shine.here",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️","2023-09-17T11:42:23.000Z","18005370562975532","0","https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/401575572_1050991609424640_7388872378202157056_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=mIwE3fPKKUkQ7kNvgEEhtZK&_nc_gid=82b9baa5eafc44cbb1c9a2d042c5972f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBxMPL-8kFiZ_5_pnl7Gf-O6yar9XpNuHMJp4tgdECBvg&oe=6716D6FA&_nc_sid=10d13b","anikanaumovski","0","@gg_golnesa","2023-09-17T11:41:38.000Z","18010568863913460","1","https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/251551138_872157233466808_8827185252379183629_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=KiSvliYcOdsQ7kNvgG7hzDs&_nc_gid=82b9baa5eafc44cbb1c9a2d042c5972f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCGbu5Bxtsxjyz3oPVDmVKGqPn3iHiUsPjpTJCU5mZPVA&oe=6716BEF5&_nc_sid=10d13b","elhaam1981",,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2023-09-17T00:43:06.000Z","17985489716376178","1","https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/408109528_747642187383829_494810192388663381_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=vBCiY-y6T10Q7kNvgGfrB4W&_nc_gid=82b9baa5eafc44cbb1c9a2d042c5972f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBrK8Bz5iBak_ZDKiVQbwYDohcDOIS4mcF0jQe2im1xdg&oe=6716C497&_nc_sid=10d13b","whatevermahsa",,,,,,,,"0","""I sinned a sin full of pleasure,

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 13, 2023.","(27/54) “One morning I was called into the Speaker’s office along with another colleague. We were told that he’d received a call from the king’s office, and the king needed our two votes on an upcoming issue. My colleague was silent. But I replied: ‘I cannot do it. If I was a soldier of the king, I would crawl across the floor at his command. But I am a representative of the people. And I answer only to them.’ When I looked over, my colleague had tears in his eyes. Nobody disobeyed a direct request from the king. But Iran was a constitutional monarchy. We had a constitution. That was supposed to mean something. It had to mean something—or we were left with nothing but a king. I knew I wasn’t helping my career. The parliament was a corrupted system, and the only way to advance was to support the king. But I wasn’t there to be part of the system. I was there to scream 𝘈𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘪. Freedom. One afternoon the Speaker told me the king would be making a trip to Nahavand, and I should be there to greet him at the airport.  I searched Shahnameh for the perfect quote to welcome him. I chose from one of my favorite stories: the story of Rostam and Esfandiyar. In this story Rostam is a much older man. He’s served many kings. But the current king has turned oppressive, and Rostam refuses to obey his commands. The king sends his son Esfandiyar to arrest Rostam. Esfandiyar promises Rostam that the king only wishes to set an example. He says: ‘Please, just let me bind your hands.’ He promises that he’ll immediately be released. He promises Rostam all the riches of Iran, if only he’ll allow his hands to be bound. Esfandiyar is protected by a divine blessing. He has never been beaten in battle. And Rostam knows that if they fight, he will almost certainly die. But still, he will not allow his hands to be bound.  He’d never give up his 𝘢𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘪. Here Ferdowsi shows his genius. The dialogue is rich. The men dine together. They share wine. They flatter each other. Each man does everything to persuade the other to change his mind. But their fate was already written. They would battle to the death. Because one could not disobey his king. And the other could not disobey his code.”","Photo by Humans of New York on September 13, 2023.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377565761_6721421374616500_7499853984768283534_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=iJPSs-FKck8Q7kNvgFSeHtj&_nc_gid=5b3cb8af17894605bf00cadfcba26aa4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAIIJ1vtr6PMaa3Ua3xm5JvGZEOuAkrxE6rrpHaZpmSzw&oe=6716E1E0&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3191212324978274908",,,"CxJdrOpLbJc",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxJdrOpLbJc/","Photo by Humans of New York on September 13, 2023.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/378017597_3593583200962343_2852054488827187117_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=P9cuS1x_VcYQ7kNvgE35E0W&_nc_gid=5b3cb8af17894605bf00cadfcba26aa4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDUwu0leWnuaGaSx2ezVoXRCrPxA388xTq8_roXd9G89g&oe=6716C7C3&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3191212324978267921",,,"CxJdrOpLZcR",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxJdrOpLZcR/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"101","720","1080","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377565761_6721421374616500_7499853984768283534_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=iJPSs-FKck8Q7kNvgFSeHtj&_nc_gid=5b3cb8af17894605bf00cadfcba26aa4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAIIJ1vtr6PMaa3Ua3xm5JvGZEOuAkrxE6rrpHaZpmSzw&oe=6716E1E0&_nc_sid=10d13b","❤️","3191212330455928686","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377565761_6721421374616500_7499853984768283534_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=iJPSs-FKck8Q7kNvgFSeHtj&_nc_gid=5b3cb8af17894605bf00cadfcba26aa4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAIIJ1vtr6PMaa3Ua3xm5JvGZEOuAkrxE6rrpHaZpmSzw&oe=6716E1E0&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/378017597_3593583200962343_2852054488827187117_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=P9cuS1x_VcYQ7kNvgE35E0W&_nc_gid=5b3cb8af17894605bf00cadfcba26aa4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDUwu0leWnuaGaSx2ezVoXRCrPxA388xTq8_roXd9G89g&oe=6716C7C3&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18081044689377510","1","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/251551138_872157233466808_8827185252379183629_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=KiSvliYcOdsQ7kNvgHdQFMo&_nc_gid=5b3cb8af17894605bf00cadfcba26aa4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA5iPVCo_liWM33azbnNY-E2RDki5BRpusX0K-nZcHnbg&oe=6716BEF5&_nc_sid=10d13b","elhaam1981",,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2023-09-17T00:55:43.000Z","18032780386605954","1","https://instagram.fixm4-3.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/44884218_345707102882519_2446069589734326272_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e0_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fixm4-3.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=CWrd8f4xNJwQ7kNvgFTb2qO&_nc_gid=d01f55f7c00942a3826112c349c96fcf&edm=AFs-eF8BAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=YW5vbnltb3VzX3Byb2ZpbGVfcGlj.3-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYDaH62eSy-E28LrUIzxdpoT2MJ7z9UQuZBgWk8VGUseNQ&oe=6716D24F&_nc_sid=72eed0","laravanwick",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Super story , special people","2023-09-16T13:00:04.000Z","18007841863818676","1","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/453511295_1782171662312532_8823095390480144178_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=S4PD6dZMBXIQ7kNvgEyaveO&_nc_gid=5b3cb8af17894605bf00cadfcba26aa4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDhw6dbSIcHvratY2qTir14TOdvyZwfYCr1v2sLsI93sQ&oe=6716DF82&_nc_sid=10d13b","gebo117",,,,,,,,"0","The code, we should never forget of our code.","2023-09-16T12:19:16.000Z","18016635307677108","1","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/425677306_341340135546152_524945322153679591_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=WgmwC5fZ2kQQ7kNvgHlmpNc&_nc_gid=5b3cb8af17894605bf00cadfcba26aa4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAGAvvClqQ81qZUZN9kN9OEdzG6EqAG3nsFk-Daith_Dw&oe=6716E3CF&_nc_sid=10d13b","katherinemitchell",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","This should be released in book form.","2023-09-16T11:54:49.000Z","17842300920073171","3","https://instagram.fixm4-3.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/44884218_345707102882519_2446069589734326272_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e0_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fixm4-3.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=CWrd8f4xNJwQ7kNvgFTb2qO&_nc_gid=d01f55f7c00942a3826112c349c96fcf&edm=AFs-eF8BAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=YW5vbnltb3VzX3Byb2ZpbGVfcGlj.3-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYDaH62eSy-E28LrUIzxdpoT2MJ7z9UQuZBgWk8VGUseNQ&oe=6716D24F&_nc_sid=72eed0","zamaneyema","0","As an Iranian specialist in constitutional studies, I have to day that this man has my total respect. Unlike a lot of emotion driven current Pahlavists, he understood the meaning of a constitutional monarchy. Governing must be a collective effort, not just one man's words. The Shah, like many Iranians, did not understand the harmful consequences of breaking the social contract that is the constitution. The rule of law and democratic decision-making were chipped away every time the King would order a democratically-elected representative around, so much that the Iranians weren't even suspicious of the terrifyingly clear words of Khomeini when he explained how the freedoms were going to be taken away. Being aware of what the Pahlavis did wrong, will in no way mean that we cannot honor them for the progresses they helped achieve in Iran and continue their developmental policies.","2023-09-16T10:56:35.000Z","18234541615228626","1","https://scontent-mia3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/70012515_419242382060330_3043640883686670336_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=db4phfrubPAQ7kNvgGXBA0N&_nc_gid=5b3cb8af17894605bf00cadfcba26aa4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAFDCmR4NVRhDz6ypWBlQcuvzMJj8EViktI9hcTzoYQ6w&oe=6716E6EA&_nc_sid=10d13b","bellastreatsug",,,,,,,,"0","😢","2023-09-15T00:17:43.000Z","17984546567193363","1","https://scontent-mia3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/452455842_2235678783459778_8560196522696144508_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=z4mOtQ3OQm8Q7kNvgHEmo6w&_nc_gid=5b3cb8af17894605bf00cadfcba26aa4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCRb0YJiI9jSdwKz1MvH7Elo8Qnu5VmxzTU2ScrzVHJhg&oe=6716E656&_nc_sid=10d13b","zahrapedramjafari",,,,,,,,"0","Parviz was not the advocate of a King who loved Iran as much as he loved it and yet he was in the parliament!","2023-09-14T23:31:36.000Z","17991945752332158","8","https://scontent-mia3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/287486505_809804073528147_1645153141460366069_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=E3nebLHTDZAQ7kNvgEB_aHK&_nc_gid=5b3cb8af17894605bf00cadfcba26aa4&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBzzJJ2dYo4_39Z_soMYZ-pZtJcDrArM0pgBm80DK21jw&oe=6716CF0F&_nc_sid=10d13b","seraa_mo",,,,,,,,"0","The text in Farsi is beautifully written.

It hadn’t changed much in thirty years, but I had changed. I had a better understanding of the sacrifice he’d made for his ideals. Ferdowsi worked for thirty-three years. Seven verses a day. 𝘈 𝘤𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘭𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘥𝘴, 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘯𝘰 𝘸𝘪𝘯𝘥 𝘰𝘳 𝘳𝘢𝘪𝘯 𝘸𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘥𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘰𝘺. While my children played in the gardens I stood quietly at the foot of his tomb. I ran my fingers across the stones. ‘In The Name of The God of Soul and Wisdom.’ 𝘑𝘢𝘢𝘯 and 𝘒𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘥. The two things all humans have. The wisdom to choose. And the soul to create. When I received the development budget for Nahavand, I called a meeting in the town’s biggest auditorium. Each village sent a representative. I told them: ‘God created the earth, the trees, and the waters—but after that he did not make a single chair. He has left the rest to us.’ I told them: ‘Organize a council, assess your own needs, make specific proposals.’ I’d only pay for things that could be seen, because I wanted no corruption in Nahavand. And priority was given to projects where labor was provided by the villagers themselves. I wanted them to get involved, participate. I wanted them to feel a sense of ownership. I wanted an Iran where everyone felt like the king or queen of their own country. Back then it was common for villagers to kiss the hands of government officials. I would not allow it. I told them: ‘We don’t need to do this anymore.’ If I was unable to stop them in time, I’d kiss their hand right back. There was one woman in Nahavand who lived in a tent. I promised her that I would not own a home before she did. I tended Nahavand like I tended my garden. I picked every weed the moment it appeared.  I followed up on every call, every letter. My phone was never unplugged. My plan was to serve two or three terms, so that I could gain some experience and build my name. Then I’d bring my ideas directly to the people. What I could do for my garden, I could do for Nahavand. And what I could do for Nahavand, I could do for all of Iran.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"119","720","1080","https://scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377956781_850404336692727_8101461433526484754_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=_aA4C7JHDAMQ7kNvgEj260_&_nc_gid=b944c35165f34e699abc04a89223c615&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAnlQoPaVgP0MzGtrtpIgxVbfluMYAiBGX0RrJywdEDhw&oe=6716C29B&_nc_sid=10d13b","پدرم باهاتون چقدر شکار و کوه می رفتید😢😢❤️❤️خوش قلب مهربان","3191035406912054638",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18004644611321977","0","https://scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/431478269_776003250629932_5218002067061549604_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=natEzjC5afUQ7kNvgGDGZ-I&_nc_gid=b944c35165f34e699abc04a89223c615&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDLs5l8R8YIWO2PGbyUJU9CbQnqm23bdTBFaljt_-DVog&oe=6716BC2F&_nc_sid=10d13b","zangenehho",,,,,,,,"0","پدرم باهاتون چقدر شکار و کوه می رفتید😢😢❤️❤️خوش قلب مهربان","2023-12-01T01:44:21.000Z","18102406432342081","1","https://scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/436333560_786797366761156_4115476778382239611_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=87Ob9ZYRuMMQ7kNvgHCG95n&_nc_gid=b944c35165f34e699abc04a89223c615&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBQee_GK-2D-FFJsVpd24NU9VZ5IKpscgghIZEf1zWRrw&oe=6716BB83&_nc_sid=10d13b","govindpilla",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Leaders are born","2023-09-18T14:18:05.000Z","17972675822602345","1","https://scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/462448321_1647580679157289_6897924558377372278_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=0nyMIwpXzYoQ7kNvgEJ8e54&_nc_gid=b944c35165f34e699abc04a89223c615&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAFa1Xnjdb6DLj4AeZIlLQrkbpz1mca6umWDxvuLl3VYQ&oe=6716D3A7&_nc_sid=10d13b","revamenon",,,,,,,,"0","Im in tears.","2023-09-17T15:10:39.000Z","18005452780848458","1","https://scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/251551138_872157233466808_8827185252379183629_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=KiSvliYcOdsQ7kNvgHQv-96&_nc_gid=b944c35165f34e699abc04a89223c615&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCQERRDctn6QfCJ64fs8Z8_p9k3GKh8jXhoPqCDcUrbmQ&oe=6716BEF5&_nc_sid=10d13b","elhaam1981",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2023-09-16T15:27:08.000Z","17928642860759714","1","https://scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/19622811_1360575877391300_2367256987097366528_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=3xWbP9Rv9jEQ7kNvgFD7ASU&_nc_gid=b944c35165f34e699abc04a89223c615&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDwHtQZCZuJiPIXGv4xP43ToVcFHLvguK7khNrHMCMD1g&oe=6716DCD7&_nc_sid=10d13b","van1llablaq","0","Jaan and Kherad😢 what has happened to our world💔","2023-09-16T14:16:17.000Z","18382474738015318","1","https://scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/338593941_1409099159904874_4300932376055503634_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=mZYMUb5fz04Q7kNvgG6Fh3_&_nc_gid=b944c35165f34e699abc04a89223c615&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCzlB36d_hBUSLDJ8d1Zis_Su9i9XMGwc9bIxy0qbMQfQ&oe=6716CC41&_nc_sid=10d13b","andreaandrezo",,,,,,,,"0","👏👏👏","2023-09-16T03:14:48.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"28698",,,,,,,,,,"Humans of New York","242598499","humansofny",,"CxI1cu2r-Vu","2023-09-13T16:04:45.000Z","Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxI1cu2r-Vu/",,,,

One day Khomeini gave a speech saying that the moment had arrived for a true Islamic revolution. And that it was the duty of all Muslims to oppose the monarchy. The rioters targeted anything they deemed anti-Islamic: cinemas, liquor stores, shops selling Western clothes. When the police tried to crack down, a few of the rioters were killed. Khomeini declared the men to be martyrs, and forty days later a public memorial was held. Huge crowds came out. And the rioting began again. It was as constant as the beat of a drum: riots, deaths, memorial. Riots, deaths, memorial. Every forty days there would be another wave. And with every wave the destruction would grow. Eventually the riots spread to the capital. Many mornings I would walk to parliament because the traffic was so bad. One morning I was forced to take a different route entirely, because rioters were destroying a liquor store. They were breaking hundreds of bottles in the street, and the gutters were filled with liquor. My colleagues in parliament were nervous, but I was optimistic. I thought this might even be an opportunity for us. Our entire careers we’d been in the opposition. We often spoke against the king’s policies. Now the people were mobilized. They were in the streets. They were looking for an alternative. Maybe this would be the moment that the king would finally hear the voice of the people. Maybe this would be the moment for us to have a true constitutional monarchy. Khomeini wanted to bring Iran back to the dark ages.  But I knew that Khomeini didn’t represent the Muslims of Iran. Iran had been Islamic for one thousand years. We were the nation of Rumi. The nation of Hafez. These fanatics did not represent our religion. I even gave a speech from the podium of Parliament where I quoted the Koran. It was the words of Allah: ‘Those who are furthest from evil, are closest to me.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"118","719","1080","https://instagram.fbel20-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/377949882_296610399782861_5772664951877358117_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fbel20-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=fPFxC7E3FxwQ7kNvgFKDZXN&_nc_gid=a593219b5256480687ba5b8c04645612&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDvVt98CU7a_jCH4g0tXb7qRKB9Jv5qHhHzBDSGCpq5zw&oe=6716DB7B&_nc_sid=10d13b","Clearly the king had good reasons of his own, to distrust the intent of our storyteller’s opposition to his authority.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 13, 2023.","(26/54) “Mitra was the oldest in her class, but all the younger students loved her. She knew all the latest in culture: the movies, the magazines, the trends. Every night when I came home she’d always be up listening to tapes. The seventies were a golden age of music in Iran: Googoosh, Delkash, Marzieh, Aslani, Hayedeh, Shajarian. And Mitra had many of their songs memorized. She was a great student. During the second year of her program she was chosen to study under one of Iran’s top Shahnameh professors. It was the closest she ever came to understanding me. One day in class the professor told her that every society needs a few idealists, because they’re the ones who move society forward. Often I would help with her homework, and it helped me view Shahnameh from a more academic perspective. Ferdowsi uses the mythic kings as placeholders for periods in Iran’s history. When he writes that Jamshid ruled for seven hundred years, he means that it was a time of great freedom and culture in Iran. But when Jamshid loses touch with the people, a period of terror and oppression follows. The throne is taken over by the Serpent King Zahak. In Shahnameh Zahak is the embodiment of darkness. He cares only for his own power. Two giant snakes grow out of his shoulders. The devil promises Zahak that he will stay in power, as long as he feeds the snakes with the brains of young Iranians. It had to be the brains of the young. Because young people are the ones with energy. They’re the ones with courage. They’re the ones that can overthrow the regime. One day twenty students at Mitra’s school entered the cafeteria wearing masks, and began to forcibly separate men and women. They physically assaulted any women who were wearing make-up or Western clothing.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 12, 2023.","(13/54) “In Germany we started a family. When our first daughter was born we named her Ahang. Ferdowsi uses the word a lot in Shahnameh. It means melody, but it also means willpower. Eighteen months later our son Maziar arrived. After the children were born Mitra said it was time to choose a normal profession, and secure the life that we had. At university I studied mechanical engineering. But wherever I am, I think of all of Iran. There were many Iranian students living in Germany, so I started my own version of Niroo called the Assembly of Kaveh, after one of Shahnameh’s greatest champions. Kaveh is a special champion. He was a normal man. An ordinary blacksmith. But he rallies the people to defeat Zahak—the most evil king in all of Shahnameh. Our meetings were held in the back room of a local tavern. The meetings were more cultural than political, each week we’d lecture on a different topic. But I was outspoken about my support for the White Revolution. We’d lost half our family’s land as part of the land reform, but still: I supported it. I wrote my father a letter. I said: ‘Today we can hold our heads higher, because there is more freedom in Iran.’ One day we were in the middle of a meeting when the door was kicked in. Two hundred angry men rushed into the room. They were mainly members of a leftist group, but they’d also been infiltrated by The Shah’s secret police, SAVAK. Their agents had been tasked with creating conflict between student groups. The men went around the room, knocking over furniture. One of them broke a coke bottle against the table, and wielded it as a weapon. I stood up from my chair and rolled my papers in my hand. I said: ‘Please, sit down. Let us discuss. Let us use our words.’ One of them was dressed exactly like Fidel Castro. He picked up a chair and jabbed its leg directly into my eye. Blood started streaming from my face. My friends picked me off the floor and helped me to the basement of the tavern. After a few minutes a police car arrived to take me to the hospital, and I was loaded in the back. I began to lose consciousnesses. The last thing I remember was a horrible, sharp pain in my eye. Then everything turned to black.”","Photo by Humans of New York on September 12, 2023.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-mia3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/378006431_360878659599207_5772481536106342930_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=UXXOxZbQtaoQ7kNvgGqfCDR&_nc_gid=679d13699bc947e88d3750d8715b9603&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYACL8e9qRl-EVF_FiLb_8U8GPCP8GOM2rFQ5sCtXJn94Q&oe=6716EB12&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3190360608897287215",,,"CxGcBIOuMQv",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxGcBIOuMQv/","Photo by Humans of New York on September 12, 2023.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377777402_254048597597274_3544532002126712464_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=WmXRa8n2PSQQ7kNvgGX1Qmr&_nc_gid=679d13699bc947e88d3750d8715b9603&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD6kz5AM09iQJ1THZz5WySzL9M0Fmtq3ehm_Wi4zgXLTw&oe=6716BA36&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3190360608838704995",,,"CxGcBILOt9j",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxGcBILOt9j/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"127","720","1080","https://scontent-mia3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/378006431_360878659599207_5772481536106342930_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=UXXOxZbQtaoQ7kNvgGqfCDR&_nc_gid=679d13699bc947e88d3750d8715b9603&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYACL8e9qRl-EVF_FiLb_8U8GPCP8GOM2rFQ5sCtXJn94Q&oe=6716EB12&_nc_sid=10d13b","👏👏👏","3190360614534472880","https://scontent-mia3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/378006431_360878659599207_5772481536106342930_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=UXXOxZbQtaoQ7kNvgGqfCDR&_nc_gid=679d13699bc947e88d3750d8715b9603&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYACL8e9qRl-EVF_FiLb_8U8GPCP8GOM2rFQ5sCtXJn94Q&oe=6716EB12&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377777402_254048597597274_3544532002126712464_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=WmXRa8n2PSQQ7kNvgGX1Qmr&_nc_gid=679d13699bc947e88d3750d8715b9603&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD6kz5AM09iQJ1THZz5WySzL9M0Fmtq3ehm_Wi4zgXLTw&oe=6716BA36&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18036927580853070","0","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/253169118_1055301185010385_2921897832668187988_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=2w6sibwpHBwQ7kNvgEwrqO-&_nc_gid=679d13699bc947e88d3750d8715b9603&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDjGNLyU9NuX6UsIQU_7zHuovg_2L9qQk8I-NusQBmoYw&oe=6716D0FC&_nc_sid=10d13b","amirhosein_atash",,,,,,,,"0","👏👏👏","2024-04-14T02:56:37.000Z","18004846106386831","0","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/454025461_1030783175105106_4963414160868547751_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=v4WhdA5xmP0Q7kNvgGlxSEt&_nc_gid=679d13699bc947e88d3750d8715b9603&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA-6Z14mLIHcteeWzEBVHrPKzCXatFd7vYeOT9DWaqnXw&oe=6716DAAC&_nc_sid=10d13b","curdeaero",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Where are all the shah dick riders now?","2024-04-01T21:05:26.000Z","17997300710172845","2","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/387265891_263428662795000_7516396856928784376_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=mfCXiWUiazMQ7kNvgGvRL8p&_nc_gid=679d13699bc947e88d3750d8715b9603&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD3IJyN20BwYjhpAPaKdqGOrSVQo1Z3y9D-vOc4omDusQ&oe=6716D05C&_nc_sid=10d13b","shooshmama","18082861660375743","2","https://scontent-mia3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/246249684_293504742403505_5268151122773654280_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=N8iRBEALqrYQ7kNvgEzgfje&_nc_gid=679d13699bc947e88d3750d8715b9603&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCzqmkR6ZLyeWeDIo8Whr_AWsWNWlwwlcROwRoejHRNiA&oe=6716DD48&_nc_sid=10d13b","phillip.neman","0","@shooshnaz so proud of my name :)","2023-09-26T06:35:02.000Z","1","@phillip.neman kaveh!!!","2023-09-25T18:24:25.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"30597",,,,,,,,,,"Humans of New York","242598499","humansofny",,"CxGcBNeuWSw","2023-09-12T17:44:04.000Z","Sidecar","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxGcBNeuWSw/",,,,
"Photo by Humans of New York on September 12, 2023.","(18/54) “The king threw a celebration on the 2500th anniversary of the Persian Monarchy. It was the largest gathering of world leaders in history. He constructed a city of tents around the ruins of Persepolis, where Cyrus’s grandson Xerxes ruled the ancient world. 1500 cypress trees were planted in the middle of the desert. There were vast carpets of petunias and marigolds. The king opened the ceremony with a speech at the tomb of Cyrus The Great. As he spoke, his voice shook with emotion. He said: ‘Rest in peace, for we are awake. In a troubled world, Iran still bears the message of freedom and humanity. Even in the darkest times, the torch thou lit has never died.’ The king was at the height of his power. Oil prices were at record highs. With each passing year Iran grew wealthier and wealthier, and the king gathered more power into his hands. Every New Year I would gather the children together and read from Shahnameh about the story of Jamshid—the fourth king of Iran. Jamshid was the greatest king. The wisest king. The Iranian people gathered around him in adoration, and built him a throne of sapphires, emeralds, and rubies. He taught men to build buildings. He taught men to heal the sick. He unlocked all the secrets of the world. And his throne began to float into the air. With each new gift to the people, it rose higher. And higher. And higher. Until one day it rose too high. Jamshid lost touch with the people. He could no longer hear their voice. He no longer wanted their participation. He gathered his advisors around him, and announced: ‘All good things come from me. I am the maker of the world.’ As soon as he spoke these words, his throne began to fall. With tears of blood he begged for pardon, but none was given. And the dread of coming darkness was his lot.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"306","720","1080","https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/378491724_2869291733212584_686803044904767186_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=A6kq8a8E_aAQ7kNvgGUEDxt&_nc_gid=6064ab6328d54e84a446cfe39be90cd0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCEPcqnQcMdWVjcORY2mWIIyyUIFAig_N5Ed_4mtV6Nkg&oe=6716EA25&_nc_sid=10d13b","❤️","3190545640282589338",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18020940670683234","0","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/357775783_976447306891137_6364252095275834923_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=ZtCyxvUDI6cQ7kNvgFHf6rk&_nc_gid=6064ab6328d54e84a446cfe39be90cd0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYByZSoLpRX3JI1ulYf_0vUqrK57kt8q2yy0Z6VTHsRVlA&oe=6716B9A7&_nc_sid=10d13b","mahshadvr",,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2023-09-18T04:28:37.000Z","17963455733636509","1","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/462252303_457161230677928_3905569507301397142_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=db8J9HDsAwQQ7kNvgGIr7Pt&_nc_gid=6064ab6328d54e84a446cfe39be90cd0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYByF2mpZc8Ytj_sVQWUgTqHIdJrCNrlQ9eHaamIjIh0Pg&oe=6716E273&_nc_sid=10d13b","sadegh_k.h",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","@allmexicangringo_ دیگر سال ۵۷ نمیشود که امثال شما آدمخواران بتوانید بر افکار مردم پادشاهی خواه ایران تاثیر بگذارید","2023-10-01T07:27:27.000Z","18017981339328531","0","https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/253169118_1055301185010385_2921897832668187988_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=2w6sibwpHBwQ7kNvgFAiyxw&_nc_gid=6064ab6328d54e84a446cfe39be90cd0&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDqWsUU_rBmAVfiT0NVkisXieirnJXbTDV0D0jsnf8wDA&oe=6716D0FC&_nc_sid=10d13b","amirhosein_atash",,,,,,,,"0","@humansofny عجب قلم دوست‌داشتنی ای روایتگر این برهه تاریخ است❤️","2024-04-14T03:03:47.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"29266",,,,,,,,,,"Humans of New York","242598499","humansofny",,"CxHGFsItwia","2023-09-12T23:51:40.000Z","Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxHGFsItwia/",,,,

And on every page she’d paste something beautiful: a flower, a feather, a line from a poem. One time we went to a large antique shop, and the owner challenged us to choose the most expensive items in the shop. Mitra looked around the store and chose two that nobody else had noticed. The owner was shocked. He announced that those were the only two that were not for sale. She had a genius for beauty. It was one of her greatest gifts. But her greatest gift by far, was her memory. Mitra could memorize an entire poem after hearing it a single time. Her favorite was Hafez: The Prince of Romance. She’d memorized two hundred of his ghazals. And whenever she found a verse that she loved, she’d bring it to me to read. We’d heard our voices many times before in arguments. But it was different when we read poetry. There was a softness, a delicacy. When you’re reading a poem, you must find the melody. 𝘈𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘨. The instrument is your throat. And the words are the notes. Some you strike suddenly—with a bang. Others you unroll gently, like a bow being slowly pulled across the string of a violin. Every word has life. Every word has its own soul. The word roar has a soul. 𝘒𝘩𝘰𝘳𝘰𝘰𝘴𝘩! And so does the word kiss. 𝘉𝘰𝘰𝘴𝘦𝘩. We were married in the traditional way. It was a small ceremony at the home of Mitra’s father. On the morning of our wedding Mitra and I visited a famous photographer in Tehran. We took a series of photographs standing side-by-side. She was so conscious of her crippled hand, she found a way to hide it in every photo. But she’d never looked so beautiful. When the session was finished, I suggested one final photograph. I could tell the photographer was annoyed, but he agreed. And it’s the photograph that still hangs in our house today. Mitra is sitting on a chair. And I’m down on one knee, looking up at her, holding her hand.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"250","720","1080","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/375187391_2074642186216768_6766828407829324624_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=SPtVdfWMiYAQ7kNvgFTWta0&_nc_gid=275c0aa874dc425d9dc8ba924c423e20&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD7IpRYwA9n73XUtHNs1A_YD-kkw7KyWaSteub31pMa1w&oe=6716DF13&_nc_sid=10d13b","❤️","3189828920282489850",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17927188568672279","0","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/462731361_486688454356750_5632710087877863860_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=OD9jXGtK7PsQ7kNvgF5Tphy&_nc_gid=275c0aa874dc425d9dc8ba924c423e20&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCG8szs0A9cNt7pO41rBqPFTovePnk4B_wTNmsAxq7AVw&oe=6716B8ED&_nc_sid=10d13b","asheqart",,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2023-09-18T23:49:14.000Z","17995379474018180","0","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/447922333_790926269479734_3751278801072160531_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=61olbgPmE4gQ7kNvgFIKeKA&_nc_gid=275c0aa874dc425d9dc8ba924c423e20&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCcfyR8gYc696SDBJwvd55Z_hPDkjDH0eTu9j6DQarWIg&oe=6716E47F&_nc_sid=10d13b","thealiciafowliemovingcompany",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2023-09-18T22:26:02.000Z","17930389862754920","1","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/379547034_344854347876560_5249448259813638077_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=83JjQgbcQh0Q7kNvgFbZekB&_nc_gid=275c0aa874dc425d9dc8ba924c423e20&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD7on7sfbSSzJ5zTxE3ufLZoZwb-ceLBz4sURXpST6qDA&oe=6716D2EC&_nc_sid=10d13b","aro_w",,,,,,,,"0","@_roughdraft thought of you with this description of poetry reading","2023-09-18T11:20:55.000Z","18090066490371652","0","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/31890438_1268037049996501_5252825391910879232_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=Ik2dmcMhDjoQ7kNvgGozhIH&_nc_gid=275c0aa874dc425d9dc8ba924c423e20&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCVDqFQcWaH1EAJ0EyfG9ABaRMYDaUMgc0kn-Y2rnKeow&oe=6716E701&_nc_sid=10d13b","zoe_sigman",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Oh to be loved like that.","2023-09-18T05:36:13.000Z","17860483827009893","0","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/19955310_372035213211176_8405164617889742848_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=Y52-t6uptLIQ7kNvgFN5-Km&_nc_gid=275c0aa874dc425d9dc8ba924c423e20&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAMk9qz5cF9NlW7wihv5ISTfif_XjlQz5jynsYT0Unp5g&oe=6716DDE1&_nc_sid=10d13b","lizessig","0","🌹🪶🖊️","2023-09-17T18:44:06.000Z","17903448827842410","0","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/436273390_933484445083018_6613834958669956228_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=bDmXgfxCvhQQ7kNvgGbHM8M&_nc_gid=275c0aa874dc425d9dc8ba924c423e20&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCpNyb1TECiStpo5YxbOHb4k9ztGOwgOOEZnILGJPIhhw&oe=6716DD0C&_nc_sid=10d13b","vivalafanny",,,,,,,,"0","😢❤️","2023-09-17T18:28:24.000Z","17882817938935647","0","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/453205821_467783199522773_1413075215174976344_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=IGLKqW8uVUwQ7kNvgELkvHr&_nc_gid=275c0aa874dc425d9dc8ba924c423e20&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBEoyFaEGzQqnDoD-JNFFJPMFa4chlcJf0LWJPBQM-nUQ&oe=6716C7F8&_nc_sid=10d13b","kelseybulkin",,,,,,,,"0","❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️","2023-09-17T04:48:05.000Z","18355421836078524","0","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/444224620_999038678222473_4992456873994471296_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=uqWLP3V5r2sQ7kNvgGEylum&_nc_gid=275c0aa874dc425d9dc8ba924c423e20&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBBOjCrt-CQ1KvvUPPMTUwAFgqDov6CcKyIuJQlIPWL7A&oe=6716CE79&_nc_sid=10d13b","bijanj28",,,,,,,,"0","This is an easy to read version of Shahnameh for anyone interested: https://www.sasanpub.com/products/%DA%A9%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%87-%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D9%86%D8%AB%D8%B1-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86-shahnameh-ferdowsi","2023-09-19T03:12:13.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"53679",,,,,,,,,,"Humans of New York","242598499","humansofny",,"CxEjICntKP6","2023-09-12T00:07:41.000Z","Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxEjICntKP6/",,,,
"Photo by Humans of New York on September 12, 2023.","(12/54) “She was brave in many ways. But there were three things that Mitra feared most: darkness, silence, and being alone. In Germany we’d take long walks through the countryside. Mitra couldn’t stand the quiet. She’d recite entire poems back-to-back-to-back. At the time she’d gotten into modern poetry. Her favorite poet was a young woman named Forough Farrokhzad. Farrokhzad was a modern poet. She wrote in free verse. She wrote from a feminine perspective. Religious society called her a ‘whore’ and a ‘slut.’ Because she wrote about everything. Including sex. By the time we finished Shahnameh I think I’d destroyed Mitra’s interest in the book. The book’s longest section is the historical section. Here the heroic nature of the prose fades. There are no more dragons. No more Rostam and Gordafarid. Here Ferdowsi writes about real people. He must stick to what is known. You can’t turn a real person into a mythic hero. That summer I took a road trip home to Iran. The Shah had just announced his White Revolution. It was a sweeping campaign of reform. Women were given the right to vote. Factory workers gained a share in profits. Agricultural estates were seized and redistributed to the sharecroppers who worked the fields. With one referendum the Shah gave more freedom to millions of Iranians. But not everyone supported it. When I arrived in Tehran the city was in chaos. Several buildings on my street were in flames. A cleric named Khomeini had come out against The White Revolution, and he’d ordered his followers to riot. Khomeini practiced a different kind of Islam. This was not the Islam of our fathers. This was not the Islam of the Persian Mystics. This was an Islam of cutting off hands, death for nonbelievers, and oppression of women. We thought these things were demons from our history. Monsters buried far in our past. But there’s a parable in 𝘔𝘢𝘴𝘯𝘢𝘷𝘪, where Rumi writes about a dragon frozen in a block of ice. The dragon seems to be dead. So the people place him on a cart and wheel him into the center of the city. They’ll soon discover that he’s still alive. He was only sleeping, waiting for things to heat up.”","Photo by Humans of New York on September 12, 2023.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377466504_336896732119055_9090711792993733972_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=PhKZCGyCzioQ7kNvgH7Zmp7&_nc_gid=3c104cba477f4c2a844532c6435bff58&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDnLp1qYgySo5Vi2HT71vBJh4YymX5DFt-Lo3x4uV4CGw&oe=6716BE7E&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3190325572482704663",,,"CxGUDSBrSUX",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxGUDSBrSUX/","Photo by Humans of New York on September 12, 2023.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/378045855_236657922701926_3194438872969868487_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=PB0at1bVBqsQ7kNvgHdSuji&_nc_gid=3c104cba477f4c2a844532c6435bff58&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDxYQ6DMWm5uMbcG_kSaZl0TkVjsNwQBU4e-upps0QkGw&oe=6716DA04&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3190325572474398742",,,"CxGUDSBLmgW",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxGUDSBLmgW/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"146","720","1080","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377466504_336896732119055_9090711792993733972_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=PhKZCGyCzioQ7kNvgH7Zmp7&_nc_gid=3c104cba477f4c2a844532c6435bff58&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDnLp1qYgySo5Vi2HT71vBJh4YymX5DFt-Lo3x4uV4CGw&oe=6716BE7E&_nc_sid=10d13b","Your writing is mesmerizing and the weaving of historical events and the stories of the Shahnameh so well done!

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 12, 2023.","(17/54) “We still took long walks together. Mitra hated walking through deep forests, they were too dark. She’d imagine that predators were hiding behind every tree. By that time I’d begun to organize the workers at my factory. I’d hold weekly meetings and speak to them about their rights, but Mitra wanted me to stop. She thought it was too dangerous to speak out in a closed society. The Shah had brought many freedoms to Iran, but there’s one place he stopped short: political freedom. No dissent was allowed. No criticism appeared in the media. And his secret police SAVAK had a reputation for violence. Many of his political opponents shared brutal stories of their treatment in prison. After our Niroo meetings Parvaneh became extremely anti-Shah. She was the basketball player; the one with the strongest voice. She married a fellow activist named Dariush Forouhar, and she joined the party he had formed. They wanted nothing less than full political freedom. And both of them went to jail several times for their views. Dr. Ameli tried to work within the system. He’d become a member of parliament, but when he spoke out against the king the Pan-Iranist Party was banned. The king saw himself as a king of old. He wanted to rule Iran with a single voice. One year I decided to write about the history of our factory. I saw it as a great example of the Iranian people coming together for a common cause. Forty thousand people were involved: materials had been contributed from local mines, a dam was constructed, an entire city was built for the workers. It had truly been a national project. I spent an entire year on the book. But before it could be published, it had to be reviewed by the secret police. They told me it could not be published unless it was dedicated to the leadership of the Shah. It was abhorrent to me. The Shah played a role, but the factory had been built by the people. By giving all the credit to one man—it takes away their authorship. I told them: ‘Write whatever you want. But take my name off it.’”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"76","720","1080","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/376709763_963606121388234_2538407913410170398_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=KxseXU2FE7YQ7kNvgEH1c6k&_nc_gid=afad7f42d4c440aa9f9aad697681a422&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDclSC1_2Iz0GWrA5LaSzi6ifeznj5K_CsT-jXzEUf5ew&oe=6716D4A8&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3190522341552460850",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17849762817051864","0","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/380284185_2555182057998164_2240417031221235630_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=VJHDfyEr-6MQ7kNvgFDer2Q&_nc_gid=afad7f42d4c440aa9f9aad697681a422&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB4Xpt-B43vX3TcMR9SnBdv5fxEHSYsknAogTfnvUKcDw&oe=6716E520&_nc_sid=10d13b","uncommon_namexo",,,,,,,,"0","","2023-09-16T19:42:36.000Z","18003260155881043","0","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/383732672_1930437740670597_7054314163571191917_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=8v-6SFH3t9cQ7kNvgGvk9QB&_nc_gid=afad7f42d4c440aa9f9aad697681a422&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDJc-3BX5cmsh0InPYSWNRNwbcTzax5lwCQu8KWYQus1A&oe=6716D216&_nc_sid=10d13b","the_angel_bee",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","That king is beginning to sound a bit orangy…","2023-09-16T15:14:03.000Z","17883160763899934","0","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/21690365_1939388889658724_1153673050869202944_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=zyWwl6dzrzYQ7kNvgH3m7Eb&_nc_gid=afad7f42d4c440aa9f9aad697681a422&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB-t6E0mdkK_poqxt-3271jDE7Zuzm5-nusV7RsQKhHvQ&oe=6716BF79&_nc_sid=10d13b","justinthegreene",,,,,,,,"0","@tattynyc don’t overthink it, many people likely simply don’t want to read a 50+ piece post.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 12, 2023.","(20/54) “Dr. Ameli helped me open a party office. He was an established man by then. But he took the time to come to Nahavand, and I’ll never forget the speech that he gave. He said: ‘Now it is winter, the rivers are frozen, the trees are all dead. But soon green sprouts will burst from the soil. The air will fill with the songs of nightingales. And together we will say: 'Spring has arrived.'” There were over one hundred villages in Nahavand, and I made the decision to visit every single one. My father loaned me his jeep, and I would spend all day on the road. Most villages had a central square, and that is where I would speak. I was a practicing Muslim; I knew the Koran front-to-back. But I never spoke about religion. I spoke about what needed to be done: better roads, better schools, fresh water. I spoke about justice. Daad. About an Iran where every person got their fair share. And I spoke about freedom. Azadi. I told them: ‘The king should not choose your candidates. All of Iran should be your candidates.’ In the first few villages only a handful of people came to my speeches. It was not customary for candidates to speak directly to the voters. My two opponents stayed in their homes and held fancy parties with their friends. But as I continued to speak, word began to spread. More people came, and then those people would go tell others. I’d always give my speeches around 6 pm. Some of the stores began to close early, so that the shopkeepers could attend. At first it was just a few. But by the end of my campaign, every single shop would close. The moment my jeep pulled into town, it would be met by cheering crowds. Hundreds of people would gather around to hear me. People as far as the eye could see. On the day of the vote I took the jeep for one final trip around Nahavand. I remember seeing young women, with babies on their breast, going to cast their vote. Later that night the results were announced on television. Early in the day people began to gather around my father’s house. When the vote was announced, the crowd erupted into cheers. Each of my opponents had gotten two thousand votes. I received over twenty thousand.”","Photo by Humans of New York on September 12, 2023.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377692248_23934144582865707_5285918743820881648_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=aqaFVQsYtUAQ7kNvgGU62To&_nc_gid=75c5c9dcac8f46bd92ab3c8b78947202&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAodbPmYYaQEOSfKN9BOC6PA4uVnSQ6_4n9U3jSyu8XxQ&oe=6716CACA&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3190582286864505000",,,"CxHOa97Nlio",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxHOa97Nlio/","Photo by Humans of New York on September 12, 2023.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/376692543_865752837823380_6406061329432306899_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=L1icoCWvGlMQ7kNvgE92eQa&_nc_gid=75c5c9dcac8f46bd92ab3c8b78947202&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAvM66bs35RVgCl7xdj38XDzqyMCkXIElTYp8C_Rw-L5g&oe=6716E08E&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3190582287032321320",,,"CxHOa-FNwUo",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxHOa-FNwUo/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"176","720","1080","https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377692248_23934144582865707_5285918743820881648_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=aqaFVQsYtUAQ7kNvgGU62To&_nc_gid=75c5c9dcac8f46bd92ab3c8b78947202&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAodbPmYYaQEOSfKN9BOC6PA4uVnSQ6_4n9U3jSyu8XxQ&oe=6716CACA&_nc_sid=10d13b","@goulartmcnerney @irn_brutus 😭 oor evan","3190582290966596977","https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377692248_23934144582865707_5285918743820881648_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=aqaFVQsYtUAQ7kNvgGU62To&_nc_gid=75c5c9dcac8f46bd92ab3c8b78947202&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAodbPmYYaQEOSfKN9BOC6PA4uVnSQ6_4n9U3jSyu8XxQ&oe=6716CACA&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/376692543_865752837823380_6406061329432306899_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=L1icoCWvGlMQ7kNvgE92eQa&_nc_gid=75c5c9dcac8f46bd92ab3c8b78947202&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAvM66bs35RVgCl7xdj38XDzqyMCkXIElTYp8C_Rw-L5g&oe=6716E08E&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17917526264746879","0","https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/164467802_480615492970889_5027675702502513239_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=_-zqbYRaRTQQ7kNvgF-RiL8&_nc_gid=75c5c9dcac8f46bd92ab3c8b78947202&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCuGpFMx99xR3cvb24K0XKCdh16MBzAG9g9Tp-tvvwM1Q&oe=6716E429&_nc_sid=10d13b","ionlyshitatwork",,,,,,,,"0","@goulartmcnerney @irn_brutus 😭 oor evan","2023-11-16T23:47:37.000Z","17892700835912834","0","https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/275868630_144897511349029_547187248397869341_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=5o47PpiiLpcQ7kNvgE44Y8K&_nc_gid=75c5c9dcac8f46bd92ab3c8b78947202&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCbqJ-LgATR6gGHTVG9Mv5WG9gA8UGkpejt0EBBy8SWqg&oe=6716E1F2&_nc_sid=10d13b","naturalisa88",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","This made me cry.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 12, 2023.","(19/54) “It has always been my philosophy: wherever I am, I try to make the most of the responsibilities I am given. Managing a factory was not my ideal position. I had hoped to find a place where I could have more of a national impact. But I tried my best to improve the lives of the people nearest to me. I continued to hold meetings with the workers. I studied employment practices from all over the world, and drafted a policy of worker’s rights. It was very progressive for the time. But when I presented the document to the Department of Labor— it was approved for the entire factory. Five thousand lives were made better.  In 1975 the king made an announcement that he was dissolving all political parties and combining them into one. He claimed that it was an attempt at unity, but it was abhorrent to me. A country cannot be ruled by a single voice. In the next election I decided to return to Nahavand and run for parliament as my own man. Mitra was against it. She told me that I was too honest for politics, too naive. She said: ‘Even if you win. You’re a single voice. The rest of the parliament will still be controlled by the king.’ Even my father didn’t want me to run. He didn’t think I stood a chance, and he didn’t want to see me get my heart broken. The king had to approve all candidates, and he’d chosen two of his closest allies as my opponents. One of them played volleyball with the king and empress. The other was Undersecretary of Education for the entire country. He was so confident of his victory that he’d already resigned from his previous position. After I announced my candidacy, he paid me a visit. He told me: ‘I want you to know. Everyone in government is supporting me. And this position has been promised to me.’ I told him: ‘I’m very happy for you. I have no intention of winning.

Nenhuma descrição de foto disponível..","(11/54) Before our wedding Mitra’s father gave her one final piece of advice: ‘Never let a man enforce his opinions on you.’ And she took it to heart. She was my opposite. My antithesis. The hardest for me to convince. She would tell me I was too optimistic. She’d say that I only saw the best in things, whether that be people, Iran, or Shahnameh. After our marriage I finally convinced her to read it with me. We’d just moved to Germany so that I could attend university. Each night when I came home from class, she’d lay her head in my lap and I’d read her a chapter. It was my second time reading the book all the way through. My first time as an adult. As a boy I’d always been drawn to Rostam’s feats of strength: his taming of Rakhsh, his defeat of the demon king, his slaying of the dragon.  But now I noticed something else. Rostam lived by a code. He would not serve an evil king. He would only serve his ideals. 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥. Justice. 𝘙𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘪. Truth. And most of all, 𝘈𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘪. Freedom. Rostam would never sacrifice his freedom. The great champions of Shahnameh were more than warriors, they were vessels for our ideals. Even in the darkest times, even in the times of greatest danger, they lived by their code. I did my best to interest Mitra in certain parts. When I came to the story of the female knight Gordafarid, I quickened my pace. I filled my words with excitement: ‘The battle was nearly lost. Gordafarid’s commander had been captured on the battlefield. Her castle was completely surrounded by the enemy. Gordafarid tried to rally the men to fight, but none would join her. They wanted to stay behind the castle walls. They wanted to surrender. Gordafarid’s cheeks turned black with rage. She grabbed her bow and arrow, tied her hair beneath her helmet, and rode out to face the enemy alone. She stopped just short of the enemy lines, and like a lion she roared: '𝘞𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘮𝘱𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴?’ In the heat of the story, I peeked down at Mitra to see if she was scared. But she’d fallen asleep.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"108","720","1080","https://instagram.fvix5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/377253102_278951961605818_3922179654963736264_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fvix5-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=BR0vcJG3EVQQ7kNvgE3f0CO&_nc_gid=60ff22aeabbc4556bc17b6770093b16b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCdOQFKn_gExzMSKmOBTTCcJy_BHw0Kgono__HjVxSK9Q&oe=6716DD76&_nc_sid=10d13b","Western fairytales like Snow White trying to modernize in 2023 and women still fighting for equal rights … Iranian tales from 2,500 years ago: women are commonly portrayed as hero warriors, leading army and navy battalions.

But we were like charms on a bracelet—united by our love for Iran. It was nothing important: we’d graffiti our slogans onto walls. We’d stand on busy street corners and try to convert people to our cause. But it felt so important. We felt like we were building a new Iran around us. We held our meetings in an attic. We’d check the street for spies before we went inside. I had one of the strongest voices in the group, so I’d open each meeting by reciting a hymn about loving Iran. We’d review our activities from the previous week. Then Dr. Ameli would lead us in long discussions about the meaning of Iran. Dr. Ameli was a nationalist. But it wasn’t a nationalism of expansion. It was a nationalism of preservation. A nationalism based on history and culture, with respect for all people. That’s one of the very first things he taught us: ‘What is true, must be true for everyone.’ We learned that the Persian Empire began when Cyrus The Great united a group of nomadic tribes in 550 BC. Many consider Cyrus to be the founder of human rights. Whenever he conquered a new territory, he outlawed slavery. He allowed everyone to live with their own language and religion. In the ancient world Iranians were known as 𝘈𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘦𝘩. Free people. It’s even in the Shahnameh. When one of our champions is mistaken for an angel, he says: ‘I come from Iran. The land of the free.’ Listening to Dr. Ameli speak about the foundations of Iran, we felt like we’d discovered something hidden. An Iran built on ideals. 𝘙𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘪. 𝘕𝘦𝘦𝘬𝘪. 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥. An Iran built on freedom. 𝘈𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘪. During the final meetings of 𝘕𝘪𝘳𝘰𝘰 that I ever attended, we were joined by a girl named Parvaneh. She was a basketball player; and her voice was just as strong as mine. At the close of each meeting, we’d lead the group in the swearing of seven oaths. I don’t remember all seven, but I remember the final. To give our lives for Iran.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"192","720","1080","https://scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/375413904_3519391038327020_2199707389911560599_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=TsNyZGdbJs4Q7kNvgFsR6d3&_nc_gid=a88d8d85397c456d8a9d81df93de1f30&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBjz4jZJ20Yqygl5ODn7djz853moOec0MpOhXUDz7_BAA&oe=6716B946&_nc_sid=10d13b","“What is true must be true for everyone” 🙌","3189784749722575360",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18010086652906709","1","https://scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/329083158_706697487672294_874608831565277714_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=XNsum6MAngsQ7kNvgGdxiiU&_nc_gid=a88d8d85397c456d8a9d81df93de1f30&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBxAFCz1Z7ZXmDxbqOEPloR9BUWd-9YVLWffKY3pedRDQ&oe=6716EA1A&_nc_sid=10d13b","amandalovescarbs",,,,,,,,"0","“What is true must be true for everyone” 🙌","2023-09-18T22:57:49.000Z","18017400511773843","0","https://scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/283858613_500786171835417_1388232361472771294_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=zA_hWGILEAcQ7kNvgHtYPTy&_nc_gid=a88d8d85397c456d8a9d81df93de1f30&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDlorw28UIYo_TC-Dv2SDwifJfMWwJgtbzy_YTOIlFvWA&oe=6716D09A&_nc_sid=10d13b","kellymiller48",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","","2023-09-17T16:17:53.000Z","17956052366529108","2","https://scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/429824086_258840627264123_7959758625357275204_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=BlSsYhLjcRkQ7kNvgFceExu&_nc_gid=a88d8d85397c456d8a9d81df93de1f30&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC3dZfLrUZru0z_WFBENlOG-nD7nmITTCbTKpKBcrM8mQ&oe=6716EBBB&_nc_sid=10d13b","dylanmulick",,,,,,,,"0","@parismansouri thank you for clarifying.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 12, 2023.","(15/54) “After my injury Mitra said it was finally time to be realistic. She began to use the words I would hear for the rest of my life: ‘You’ve already lost one eye for your ideals.’ I’d always respond the same way: “I’ve still got one eye left. And I’d like to see the world for as beautiful as it is.’ When we came home from Germany I promised that I’d never leave Iran again. Not even once. Not even on vacation. The only job I could find was at a steel factory. It wasn’t my ideal position. But wherever I am, I think of all of Iran. It was my hope that I could gain some experience and spearhead an industrial policy for the entire country. Inside the house Mitra was queen. She wanted everything in our house to be beautiful. She’d make entire booklets of beautiful things that she’d clipped from magazines: one for couches, one for lamps, one for tables. Mitra chose all of the children’s clothing. Sometimes they’d miss their bus because she was so particular. And whenever she decided—it was final. I tried to teach the children to use their voice. I’d tell them: ‘If you disagree with what I say, use your words.’ But Mitra was the opposite. She wanted her word to be the law, and that also applied to me. We once went to a famous carpet store in Tehran. Inside there were many beautiful trees. When Mitra asked the owner how he kept them so green, he said that every time he finishes a kettle of tea, he pours the remains on the roots of the trees. From that day on, Mitra made me pour the remains of our tea on the roots of our trees. She’d send me out in the middle of the night to do it. I tried to appeal to her reason. I told her that it made no sense. It was nonsensical. But inside our home her word was the law. Only once did I make a stand. When our youngest daughter was born, Mitra wanted to name her Kakoli—it’s a beautiful little bird with a plume on its head. But I had a different idea. We argued about it for weeks. And in the end we made a compromise. We agreed to call her Kakoli. But her name, would be Gordafarid.”","Photo by Humans of New York on September 12, 2023.","","0","719","1080","https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/375334293_686959206678633_630200352788037462_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=T4AHmV8PLMQQ7kNvgFKHdEC&_nc_gid=9e38945980df494bbe401e4a1b913a63&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCW64wXbWOB5R0Zq1DWGdfOJ0hq14X_thzqUDMcMomD7g&oe=6716CA5D&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3190439013659630250",,,"CxGt2EWutqq",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxGt2EWutqq/","Photo by Humans of New York on September 12, 2023.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377781022_211593675250288_1057343073056870958_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=Jw3CSA9UXk0Q7kNvgGo3nOG&_nc_gid=9e38945980df494bbe401e4a1b913a63&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAKLTF-rmpdnhU_beLrBRH9cASKXBN5sDmausFvpi7fKg&oe=6716E9E4&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3190439013659514442",,,"CxGt2EWuRZK",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxGt2EWuRZK/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"111","719","1080","https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/375334293_686959206678633_630200352788037462_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=T4AHmV8PLMQQ7kNvgFKHdEC&_nc_gid=9e38945980df494bbe401e4a1b913a63&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCW64wXbWOB5R0Zq1DWGdfOJ0hq14X_thzqUDMcMomD7g&oe=6716CA5D&_nc_sid=10d13b","In this photo Mitra resembles Giovanna Mezzogiorno, an Italian actress!","3190439019917549678","https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/375334293_686959206678633_630200352788037462_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=T4AHmV8PLMQQ7kNvgFKHdEC&_nc_gid=9e38945980df494bbe401e4a1b913a63&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCW64wXbWOB5R0Zq1DWGdfOJ0hq14X_thzqUDMcMomD7g&oe=6716CA5D&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377781022_211593675250288_1057343073056870958_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=Jw3CSA9UXk0Q7kNvgGo3nOG&_nc_gid=9e38945980df494bbe401e4a1b913a63&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAKLTF-rmpdnhU_beLrBRH9cASKXBN5sDmausFvpi7fKg&oe=6716E9E4&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18159158743293105","0","https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/328680574_740251084339698_73856871269064473_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=pKQ6GtvdzJsQ7kNvgHUUWR_&_nc_gid=9e38945980df494bbe401e4a1b913a63&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBhLARemddgkyLq8sYgjEmMy_oGa2miiwe74cZqONhwDQ&oe=6716D54D&_nc_sid=10d13b","the_rrc721",,,,,,,,"0","In this photo Mitra resembles Giovanna Mezzogiorno, an Italian actress!","2023-09-18T00:23:41.000Z","17993855636500539","2","https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/19955310_372035213211176_8405164617889742848_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=Y52-t6uptLIQ7kNvgFYRVaA&_nc_gid=9e38945980df494bbe401e4a1b913a63&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCJR-cKSmywA_C12vdxrhPp4oFsqgCRAd3bKUV0eOV7SQ&oe=6716DDE1&_nc_sid=10d13b","lizessig",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","I put my spent tea leaves around my garden too. 🌱🍵🌹","2023-09-17T19:04:39.000Z","17998336376287159","2","https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/459523403_488575137394152_6602971830464396877_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=TC-_HcmbmLsQ7kNvgFCVtYD&_nc_gid=9e38945980df494bbe401e4a1b913a63&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB4p7yTBeLIyJc7xeE_1piCcZiPw2ogkzDYJBEJFUZ0ww&oe=6716C8DA&_nc_sid=10d13b","dgorgeousone",,,,,,,,"0","😂didn’t know my real name till I went to kindergarten and teacher hit me on the heat for not responding .

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 12, 2023.","(16/54) “When the children were old enough I started reading them Shahnameh before they went to sleep. The stories of Rostam were too violent. They’d cry and cry. So I started with the stories of Iran’s mythic kings. These were the first kings of Iran. They discovered fire, language, and law. Some of them spoke to animals. Others lived for hundreds of years and sat on floating thrones made entirely of precious stones. It’s not known if Ferdowsi intended to name his book Shahnameh. The Book of Kings. But the title fits. For as long as there has been an Iran, there has been a king. In 1967 Mohammed Reza held a coronation ceremony. By that time he’d already been king for twenty years. But he’d wanted his coronation to wait, until Iran was prosperous. And now it was. The Shah had come a long way since that day I’d first seen him in the shrine. He’d tightened his grip on power, and his popularity was at an all-time high. The White Revolution had been a massive success. Iran was rapidly industrializing. Millions of Iranians were lifted out of poverty. Hundreds of new schools and universities were built. And it was a time of great freedom. Iranian women had more rights than anywhere else in the Muslim world. They could vote, obtain a divorce, own property, and run for office. In the words of Saadi: ‘The homeland is where no one disturbs the other.’ In Tehran you could see women in mini-skirts standing next to women who were fully-veiled. On the day of his coronation The Shah rode to the palace in a golden carriage pulled by eight Hungarian stallions. As he passed the streets were filled with shouts of ‘Long Live The King!’ Trumpets blared. Guns fired. The Air Force dropped 17,532 roses from the sky. One for every day of his life. At the coronation a crown of diamonds was placed upon his head, and he took his seat on the famous Naderi throne. It was decorated with carvings of lions and dragons. And it was covered with 25,000 precious stones.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"161","720","1080","https://instagram.fcre1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/376918417_855822159278432_5730402162822848908_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fcre1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=iCO_RRNlxHQQ7kNvgGaqqAP&_nc_gid=3f87381ca3fe4b61a3c7756e3328a772&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA3cdyc-rqVHak0tyvaOjepXtFdawsgzC5ze7tth1H70w&oe=6716D33F&_nc_sid=10d13b","@tschenara تهران نامی ایرانیست و باید با. ت. نوشته شود سد هم همچنین واژه‌ای ایرانیست وباید با. س. نوشته شود.

The invaders had plundered the country. Caravans of riches were leaving day and night. There was a huge push to break our unity, to erase our identity, to make us forget ourselves. And whenever a conqueror tries to destroy a people, they begin with the language. Scholars were murdered. Books were burned. Entire libraries were razed to the ground. Whenever words were found, they were destroyed. A knight gathered all the texts that remained. And Ferdowsi stepped forward to weave them into a poem. In the prologue of Shahnameh he writes: ‘I am building a castle of words. That no wind or rain will destroy!’ Ferdowsi attempted to use only the purest form of Persian. He wanted to preserve the entirety of our language. All of our words. But it wasn’t just our language that he was trying to save, it was our story. Our wisdom. Our soul. Who we were. Ferdowsi drew from many different sources when writing Shahnameh. But one of the most important was The Avesta. The holiest book in ancient Iran. It included many of our oldest stories, from before the written word. In the heart of the book, away from the edges, safe from the sands of time, were the oldest words of Iran: the seventeen hymns of Zoroaster. They were three thousand years old.  And they’re in the form of a poem. They tell the story of a battle between two great spirits: Ahura Mazda and Ahriman. Good and Evil. Light and Dark. Since the beginning of time these two spirits have been locked in a battle for the soul of the world. And every person must participate. There can be no spectators. There is always a choice to be made. Light or Dark. Good or Evil. 𝘕𝘦𝘦𝘬𝘪 or 𝘉𝘢𝘥𝘪. It’s a simple choice. But in that choice is an escape from destiny. A promise that the book is not yet written. There is still a role for us to play.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"114","720","1080","https://instagram.fpmi1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/377566187_3444649495849417_737743168023546919_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fpmi1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=BXZjCej0-g0Q7kNvgFdHw3f&_nc_gid=990adb38acbf4eeeac5f8696fd368160&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAhVz_0hZE7pYq0XHrwpWKGWprRMo3iteVEjwYuiQ_tvQ&oe=6716C4C1&_nc_sid=10d13b","I love the last part of this passage: every person must participate in the battle of good versus evil.

"Photo by Humans of New York on June 21, 2023.","“I think when I’m old I’m going to have gray hair. It’s already turning gray, so I’ll definitely have gray hair. Maybe I’ll have bulked up at that point. My dad has skinny legs and arms—but he’s buff in the middle. So hopefully I’ll be that. I’ll probably just be sitting around. But not in a rocking chair or anything— just on the ground. Maybe in a boat. I think it would be cool to have a boat. I used to always make fun of straight dudes who talked about fishing. But now I’m thinking: maybe I should fish. Really learn to survive off the land. Like gut the fish myself and gross out the kids. Not my kids necessarily, but maybe my siblings’ kids, I’ll be the best worst uncle ever. I’m also hoping that I’ll have drawn a lot of stuff by then. Maybe even published a few books. And hopefully there will be a nice handful of people who really like my stuff. They’ll think it was a nice contribution to the world. And they’ll care when I die. But mainly I’m just glad I get to be an old man. I could never imagine myself as an old woman. Like, I couldn’t. So the future was just-- nothing. But now I’m here. So I feel like I can’t be too upset about anything, you know? Because when I looked at the future, there was nothing. And now there’s something. And that’s everything.”⁣

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 11, 2023.","(4/54) “My father named me Parviz—after one of Iran’s ancient kings. His story comes at the end of Shahnameh, in the historical section. Parviz was a good king. Not a great king, but a good king. His reign was a golden age of music. But he made many mistakes. His grandson Yazdegerd would be the last king of the Persian Empire. Every day on the way home from school I’d pass by the ruins of an ancient castle, where he made his final stand against the armies of Islam in 642 AD. The Battle of Nahavand was the bloodiest defeat in the history of our country. Most days when I got home I’d go straight to my room and read Shahnameh. The book opens in myth: our oldest stories, from before the written word. But the poets say our myths are even truer than our history. They emerge from the collective psyche. They hold our dreams. They hold our ideals. When Ferdowsi writes about our mythic heroes, he writes about all of us. And in Shahnameh there is no greater hero than Rostam. The Heart of Iran. A knight with the height of a cypress. And a voice to make, the hardened hearts of warriors quake. At one point in Shahnameh Iran is on the brink of defeat. Three enemy kings have joined their forces. Our armies are almost beaten. Rostam arrives at the battlefield on foot: no horse, no armor, carrying nothing but a bow and arrow. And with a single shot he slays the greatest champion of the other side. I wanted to be Rostam. My brother and I built a gym behind our garden. We took the heads off of shovels and made parallel bars. We made barbells out of clumps of dirt. We’d wrestle sixty times a day. And while we wrestled my brother’s friend would beat a drum and chant our favorite verses about Rostam: his defeat of the demon king, his battle with the dragon. There were no dragons in Nahavand, but there were ibex. They only lived at the highest elevations. And they were beautiful with their horns. I’d climb all night. I’d make my way by moonlight. The cliffs were covered in ice, a single slip could mean death. But I’d reach the summit by dawn, and watch the sun come up on herds of ibex grazing on the peaks.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"176","720","1080","https://instagram.fman4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/376743971_828632668912897_8754873035036250415_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fman4-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=e8EpIlecEEwQ7kNvgHv_AA6&_nc_gid=5562152371cf44e08e756dbb5dc60e7d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCEA6SYu_T4GjnfV7iYrHRUIp9oQBv0mPi59eezLUX5Kw&oe=6716D567&_nc_sid=10d13b","So beautiful and poetic ❤️","3189621392940174968",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18207595087252099","1","https://instagram.fman4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/338454944_1166931740651797_4958833099993463605_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fman4-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=4px5VOIUdCUQ7kNvgGNPD5N&_nc_gid=5562152371cf44e08e756dbb5dc60e7d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAa4KZxp0fzfVS1SRY9bq4Sm02WPz-XrIbWVPGG9bbA4A&oe=6716E5D9&_nc_sid=10d13b","shoreh_h",,,,,,,,"0","So beautiful and poetic ❤️","2023-09-17T14:44:31.000Z","17977535933582570","1","https://instagram.fman4-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/18723088_540761589645918_7953954797088931840_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fman4-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=COjTiDRx24MQ7kNvgGIPBTE&_nc_gid=5562152371cf44e08e756dbb5dc60e7d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB_ZV7RvwVVq8wFV6v-OcnDAerTG2sayBLO07Kce1cUEQ&oe=6716CF6A&_nc_sid=10d13b","dac5588",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2023-09-16T03:33:35.000Z","17968913558615324","1","https://instagram.fman4-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/334735450_2047315882282158_940669332067919119_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fman4-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=HOLNmBnaQkMQ7kNvgFpTLmH&_nc_gid=5562152371cf44e08e756dbb5dc60e7d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC0mqeRCRxVZKybwnyikEczvZCACGHlQLT-gsh8SJNXEQ&oe=6716BADE&_nc_sid=10d13b","farimehr.seyednia",,,,,,,,"0","😢","2023-09-15T18:02:57.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"46091",,,,,,,,,,"Humans of New York","242598499","humansofny",,"CxDz8HuL454","2023-09-11T17:15:21.000Z","Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxDz8HuL454/",,,,
"Photo by Humans of New York on September 11, 2023.","(3/54) “It’s been forty-three years since I’ve seen my home. All I have left is a jar of soil. It’s good soil. Nahavand is a city of gardens. A guidebook once called it ‘a piece of heaven, fallen to earth.’ The peaks are so high that they’re capped with snow. A spring gushes from the mountain, and flows into a river. It spreads through the valley like veins. We lived in the deepest part of the valley, the most fertile part. Our father owned thousands of acres of farmland. When we were children he gave us each a small plot of land to plant a garden. None of the other children had the discipline. They’d rather play games. But I planted my seeds in careful rows. I hauled water from a nearby well. I pulled every weed the moment it appeared. As the poets say: ‘If you cannot tend a garden, you cannot tend a country.’ My garden was the best; it was plain for all to see. The discipline came from my mother. She was very devout. She prayed five times a day. Never spoke a bad word, never told a lie. My father was a Muslim too, but he drank liquor and played cards. He’d wash his mouth with water before he prayed. The Koran was in his library. But so were the books of The Persian Mystics: the poets who spent one thousand years softening Islam, painting it with colors, making it Iranian. Back then it was a big deal to own even a single book, but my father had a deal with a local bookseller. Whenever a new book arrived in our province, it came straight to our house. I’ll never forget the morning I heard the knock on the door. It was the bookseller, and in his hands was a brand-new copy of Shahnameh. The Book of Kings. It’s one of the longest poems ever written: 50,000 verses. The entire story of our people. And it’s all the work of a single man: Abolqasem Ferdowsi. Shahnameh is a book of battles. It’s a book of kings and queens and dragons and demons. It’s a book of champions called to save Iran from the armies of darkness. Many of the stories I knew by heart. Everyone in Iran knew a few. But I’d never seen them all in one place before, and in a beautiful, leather-bound edition. The book never made it to my father’s library. I brought it straight to my room.”","Photo by Humans of New York on September 11,

"Photo by Humans of New York on June 27, 2023.","“Summertime and Christmas. That’s when I have her. Been that way for seven years. When she’s not in school, she’s with me. Then at the end of the summer I bring her back to her Mom’s house in Florida. Those drop-offs are the worst; I almost miss my flight every time. I wait until the last possible second to call my uber for the airport. I hug her, say goodbye, put my stuff in the car. Then I always gotta come back again and get my last kiss. Always, always. That uber ride sucks. That plane ride sucks. Cause I know I’m not going to see her for a few months. On the wall in my closet we keep track of her height. And every time she comes back, she’s grown like two inches. That’s a lot. That’s a lot I don’t see. But she knows she can call me for whatever, which she does. And whenever she’s here she gets to be the CEO of our lives. She’s not a dictator or anything. But she’s the president. I’m the people. When she says we go, we go. She wants to go to the pool, we go to the pool. She wants to go to the beach, we go to the beach. We came here today for the Juneteenth celebration. Been planning it for two weeks.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 11, 2023.","(5/54) “The meaning of our most important words I learned from my mother. 𝘙𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘪: Truth. I never heard her tell a lie. 𝘕𝘦𝘦𝘬𝘪: Goodness. I never heard her gossip. And 𝘔𝘦𝘩𝘳: Love. We were three brothers and five sisters, but she loved us all equally. There were no assigned places at our dinner table. Everyone got their desired portion. While we ate our father would encourage us to debate the events of the day. No topic was off limits: history, politics, even the existence of God. And everyone was encouraged to use their voice. One weekend my father drove us all to visit Ferdowsi’s tomb in the city of Tus. It’s a large tomb. It’s modeled after the tomb of Cyrus The Great. On its face is etched the first line of Shahnameh. The master verse. The cornerstone: ‘In the Name of the God of Soul and Wisdom.’ 𝘑𝘢𝘢𝘯 and 𝘒𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘥. Soul and Wisdom. The two things that all humans have. With the opening line Ferdowsi does away with all castes and classes. He does away with all religion. He gives everyone a direct connection to the creator. As a young boy I’d memorized hundreds of verses. One of my favorite stories in Shahnameh is when Rostam selects his horse. Rakhsh is the only horse in Iran that can carry Rostam’s weight. Rakhsh has the body of a mammoth. But he's wild, he foams at the mouth. Rostam has to fight to tame him. I was a shy child. But something happens when I read Shahnameh. There’s an epic cadence. The words demand to be spoken.  It’s like touching a hot stove. I feel the heat, I feel the pressure. It’s like a sword pierces my body and I have to let it out: ‘𝘙𝘢𝘬𝘩𝘴𝘩 𝘳𝘰𝘢𝘳𝘦𝘥 𝘣𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘩 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘮!’ The neighbors would come running to their balconies to watch. Every region in Iran has its own dialect, and I could switch between them. The language is ancient, so I didn’t know the meaning of every word. But I could feel the music. When I mispronounced a word, I knew. As if I’d played a wrong chord. I could almost tell what he wanted. I could almost hear the voice of Ferdowsi himself.”","Photo by Humans of New York on September 11, 2023.","","0","719","1080","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/376754241_212172598522046_484423685685507661_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=bd2DNqDG6GAQ7kNvgHs668Z&_nc_gid=3681c21e8a1345e19c0b0d35ecdd5570&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCpdOTuFO9vYUw1nGMZ49QRJ0LLeO4hS7EdBwVCeTLAlw&oe=6716BC32&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3189658966992504055",,,"CxD8e5SOkT3",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxD8e5SOkT3/","Photo by Humans of New York on September 11, 2023.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377546559_1023606202123404_585360953341959726_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=Y3wWXZh8CgoQ7kNvgF8BAI9&_nc_gid=3681c21e8a1345e19c0b0d35ecdd5570&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB-1JtAR1MJs0XQF7qFJhcK-Q5wwUIuGySgaZ5Be7qR0Q&oe=6716D573&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3189658966984051740",,,"CxD8e5RuUwc",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxD8e5RuUwc/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"141","719","1080","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/376754241_212172598522046_484423685685507661_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=bd2DNqDG6GAQ7kNvgHs668Z&_nc_gid=3681c21e8a1345e19c0b0d35ecdd5570&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCpdOTuFO9vYUw1nGMZ49QRJ0LLeO4hS7EdBwVCeTLAlw&oe=6716BC32&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3189658971387995327","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/376754241_212172598522046_484423685685507661_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=bd2DNqDG6GAQ7kNvgHs668Z&_nc_gid=3681c21e8a1345e19c0b0d35ecdd5570&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCpdOTuFO9vYUw1nGMZ49QRJ0LLeO4hS7EdBwVCeTLAlw&oe=6716BC32&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/377546559_1023606202123404_585360953341959726_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=Y3wWXZh8CgoQ7kNvgF8BAI9&_nc_gid=3681c21e8a1345e19c0b0d35ecdd5570&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB-1JtAR1MJs0XQF7qFJhcK-Q5wwUIuGySgaZ5Be7qR0Q&oe=6716D573&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18021441841631563","0","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/342548782_2180059038869976_4526307799914511499_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=uTpPo9eXgJEQ7kNvgF2X0nT&_nc_gid=3681c21e8a1345e19c0b0d35ecdd5570&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBc7LhWCRuM9UkwVq8fOtq4ZLCBL_G-N7IxZQnteRXoSA&oe=6716B7F3&_nc_sid=10d13b","corinaromero3",,,,,,,,"0","","2023-10-12T15:34:48.000Z","17912984594976309","1","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/448043285_1223649932350893_3766024196774203777_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=fmksc6G7CLMQ7kNvgEjjjaF&_nc_gid=3681c21e8a1345e19c0b0d35ecdd5570&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBokM_WA4ZXHvDLKFD8KN19_n4ZZeIPDY9kq_kJvlN6Bw&oe=6716C62D&_nc_sid=10d13b","cairethescary",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","@gelarehmirzadeh thank you!!!!

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 11, 2023. لا يتوفر وصف للصورة..","(6/54) “One New Year our whole family took a bus to Qom— one of the holiest cities in Iran. When we arrived in the city it was like stepping back in time. This was a different kind of Islam. It wasn’t my father’s. It wasn’t even my mother’s. It was an Islam from fourteen hundred years ago. The bookstores only stocked religious books. There were no radios, no music. My nine-year-old sister tried to buy some glass bracelets at the bazaar, but the shopkeeper wouldn’t serve her. Because she wasn’t wearing a hijab. When he turned his back I broke the bracelets against the table. In the afternoon I was given time to explore on my own. I remember I was wearing long pants. I’d never worn long pants before, so I felt like a man. I made my way to the biggest shrine in the city. There was a huge crowd for the holiday. As I pushed my way through, the crowd began to sway and move. People began to shout all around me. Hats were thrown in the air. I couldn’t see what was happening, even when I stood on the tips of my toes. But suddenly the crowd began to part. If I’d been one step further back, it would never have happened. But a path opened up in front of me. And there he was. I’d seen his portrait every day of my life on the inside cover of my Shahnameh: Mohammed Reza Shah. The king of Iran. He was not yet the famous Shah that he’d one day become. At the time he was still a young man. But on that day he seemed to me like one of the great kings of Shahnameh. I was a shy child, but something came over me. I broke free from the crowd and began to follow him. He took off his shoes, I took off my shoes. He entered the shrine, I entered the shrine. This was my chance. I’d never been so close to a king. I knew I had to do something, so I reached out. And I touched his coat. I touched the coat of a king. That night when I came home I looked at myself in the mirror. Ferdowsi describes Rostam as having the height of a cypress. And arms that could rip rocks from the side of a cliff. I took one look at my scraggly body, and decided I was much too skinny to be a knight. But my garden was the best, it was plain for all to see. So I decided I would become the shah of Iran.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"520","720","1080","https://instagram.fruh7-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/376798130_340935344941827_3645665634435841631_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fruh7-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=b1wOfUDZ5E4Q7kNvgFb7urp&_nc_gid=a1cb74b0d450474bb0e1459baed3150b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCeQ-iC8QvqAMrqqYPhfilPeknXCYRV4F3PYYtCzzuNOQ&oe=6716BF4D&_nc_sid=10d13b","❤️❤️","3189687376842163758",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17917150229928172","0","https://instagram.fruh7-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/459393970_1714980302581527_3310269281278996438_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fruh7-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=78p9fEUzioIQ7kNvgGKk47l&_nc_gid=a1cb74b0d450474bb0e1459baed3150b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAHYO-CfRRO7DeUtlmYddpzLPjwLwbSdgikUKC8A6bwLw&oe=6716EFED&_nc_sid=10d13b","sabaloatfy",,,,,,,,"0","❤️❤️","2024-05-31T11:23:01.000Z","18213663016249376","0","https://instagram.fruh7-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/461285589_541549805010367_5220828737311162125_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fruh7-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=y3fwzOd1QxIQ7kNvgFvxABE&_nc_gid=a1cb74b0d450474bb0e1459baed3150b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBWr2valNCV6_eViIgtgiIFQlZRc2e4cSV9eVROTQThTA&oe=6716C5D6&_nc_sid=10d13b","nasim_mesgarzadeh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2023-11-14T00:48:52.000Z","17876433215957267","0","https://instagram.fruh7-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/403437462_727670075949474_5780622413863862627_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fruh7-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=6-ZtbpmDrooQ7kNvgFZ0WlF&_nc_gid=a1cb74b0d450474bb0e1459baed3150b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAuJKhxskOOE_4cWktIydGDZyrBj-zpBrXZBOoiykpL3Q&oe=6716CF32&_nc_sid=10d13b","people.ofhell",,,,,,,,"0","Come on!

"Photo by Humans of New York on June 20, 2023.","“I’m the one who calls out. I’m the one who corrects. I’m the one who rephrases. I've had plenty of people be like: you can’t tell me what to say. But if you’re allowed to say whatever you want, I'm allowed to react however I want. Right? Maybe my reaction is an attempt to correct you, but you’re allowed to take it or let it go. Maybe what you said seems trivial to you. But the little things are easier to fix. And they help build a foundation. So the bigger things are easier to address. And also: do the big things even matter if you don’t care about the small things? Obviously I can’t fight everything. You do have to pick your fights. And aggression never works. Because you want to win the war, and not just the battle. But one thing I’ll never let slide is pronouns. If someone is purposely using incorrect pronouns, that’s getting corrected, on the spot. It’s baseline respect. It’s like using a mean nickname or something. It’s just not nice, you know? I know you want to use whatever language you want, but maybe it’s not about you. Maybe I’m not trying to take away your freedom. Maybe I’m not trying to make you feel like a bad person. Maybe it’s more about: let’s not hurt the person it’s affecting, you know? I was very, very close to someone who had just started transitioning. And he did everything he could to pass as a man, because he is a man. But he still had some female features. And I was with him when someone misgendered him. I could tell that he was upset, so I followed him to his room. And I watched him fall apart because of the dysphoria it caused. It’s like— you could have literally taken two seconds to choose the respectful word. But you didn’t. And look at the harm you just caused.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3569","720","1080","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/355333122_769656804800614_3220790623024051644_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=ATxQlaThmOUQ7kNvgHrwU6B&_nc_gid=c6fbf8b2a33f4fda8ccf8e57fd89d289&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAtDK0GMstbuNaOC1xJ2qZzXkmDoeZZ3m3OnDguMmgaYQ&oe=6716D165&_nc_sid=10d13b","correct not cancel","3129410304156107814",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18100122823428829","0","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/462450269_546579754520437_5314921840547503375_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=lalB_f7QWwoQ7kNvgGloBx8&_nc_gid=c6fbf8b2a33f4fda8ccf8e57fd89d289&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB082olWAHAAp9P3_025hcgPHrAYQ0AeVOsE4z257YBAw&oe=6716B902&_nc_sid=10d13b","tarushkacreations",,,,,,,,"0","correct not cancel","2024-07-26T23:30:49.000Z","17990669696609758","0","https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/454253859_2858518740967901_3174113521103166527_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=AWNxUx9CkuAQ7kNvgHMljKn&_nc_gid=c6fbf8b2a33f4fda8ccf8e57fd89d289&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD-KnhvM4YQ1DyhBxxTc2Dl8nDiIiF2Th3cDkdP-1uVWA&oe=6716EDC0&_nc_sid=10d13b","jenshin_bream",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","@jeneen928 We have all the validation we need from the real experts.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 11, 2023.","(2/54) “I couldn’t find it anywhere. Even on the streets of Tehran—it was nowhere to be seen. The Iran I knew was gone. Everywhere I turned it was nothing but black: black cloaks, black shrouds. The universities were closed, the libraries were closed. Our poets, our singers, our authors, our teachers: one-by-one they were silenced. Until Iran only survived inside our homes. I never planned to leave. I didn’t even have a passport. Twenty years earlier I’d sworn an oath to The Siren: every choice I made, I’d make for Iran. But The Siren was dead. They shredded his heart with bullets. And there was only one choice left: leave and live, or stay and die. It was an eight-hour drive to the Turkish border. Mitra came with me. We rode in silence the entire way. I’ve always wondered how things would have turned out differently if we’d been more aligned. She wanted our lives to be a love story. A surreal romantic journey. She wanted a life of togetherness, surrounded by beauty. For me life was meant to be lived in the pursuit of ideals: truth, justice, freedom. Even if that meant the ultimate sacrifice. We kissed goodbye in the border town of Salmas. In the main square stood a statue of Iran’s greatest poet: Abolqasem Ferdowsi. On that day it was still standing. Soon the regime would tear it down. I spent the night in the house of a powerful family who was known to oppose the regime. Their servants stood around the house with machine guns on their shoulders. Six months later they’d all be dead. On my final morning in Iran I woke with the sun. I knelt on the floor and prayed. The final journey was made on foot. It was six miles to the border, the road climbed through the mountains. It was a closed border; so the road was empty. Every step felt like death. I’ve never cried so many tears. Ferdowsi once wrote: ‘A man cannot escape what is written.’ I’ve always hated that quote. I hate the idea of destiny. There is always a role for us to play. There is always a choice to be made. But on that day it felt like destiny, a river flowing in one direction. And I was a leaf, floating on top. Away from where I wanted to go.”","Photo by Humans of New York on September 11,

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 11, 2023. Nenhuma descrição de foto disponível..","(7/54) ”In Shahnameh there’s one word that Rostam uses more than any other: 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥. Justice. 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥 is a simple concept. It means that everyone gets what they deserve: both good and bad. Everyone gets a fair share. The Nahavand of my childhood was very poor. People would come to our door each day asking for a single piece of bread. It seemed unjust to me. So I decided I would not eat more than that. My mother begged and begged, but I would not do it. I decided that if I became king, every child in Iran would be given their fair share. But until then I should participate in their suffering. I had no idea how I would become king. In Shahnameh it seemed so simple. Good kings glowed with light. Their wisdom was plain for all to see. I was an optimistic child. I felt that if I could use my voice, and speak about 𝘥𝘢𝘢𝘥—then a path would open up before me.  When I turned fifteen I went to boarding school in Tehran. It was nothing like Shahnameh. Half a million people lived there, and it was a time of great upheaval. A huge debate was being held over the nationalization of oil. The streets were filled with voices of every kind, and nobody could agree on the future of Iran. I realized that many people didn’t want the same things that I wanted, and for complicated reasons. At the end of each week I’d go to the house of a relative to pick up my allowance. His wife was the first person in Iran to have a cooking show on the radio, so sometimes I’d stay for dinner. They had a young daughter named Mitra. Her hair was cut short in the style of a famous American actor. One of her hands was crippled by polio. She was very shy about it, but it was never something I noticed. Back then most Iranian girls were modest and deferential, but not Mitra. And she argued with everyone: her friends, the help, her family, and me. One night over dinner I started speaking about the past greatness of Iran: who we were. Back in the days of Shahnameh. When I finished talking, Mitra was the first to speak. She said: ‘You talk about Iran like it’s a lion. But it’s a cat.” That was the year I discovered something new. There are love stories in Shahnameh too.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"138","720","1080","https://instagram.fvcp10-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/376849472_257886310544223_2959197816394597588_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fvcp10-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=VD92N-lu4BEQ7kNvgEMNVQr&_nc_gid=d06247a33945479385bc279eec47aa73&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDzA_591Cqr-Qc5KtqaoKsDG1KUy5jRlppoT8kAZaAnuA&oe=6716BB4D&_nc_sid=10d13b","❤️","3189719197852184778",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17953614347660191","0","https://instagram.fvcp10-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/459523403_488575137394152_6602971830464396877_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fvcp10-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=TC-_HcmbmLsQ7kNvgE5UuLE&_nc_gid=d06247a33945479385bc279eec47aa73&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDszIc7kiiEB8zuFmPyYcIcqwOUEXIoAIMsLgx-Uarpcg&oe=6716C8DA&_nc_sid=10d13b","dgorgeousone",,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2023-09-17T09:40:51.000Z","18033052447584836","0","https://instagram.fvcp10-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/348641411_178001894894872_3384775932895311608_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fvcp10-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=LeTRfxBcm3cQ7kNvgHtJm5O&_nc_gid=d06247a33945479385bc279eec47aa73&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCiPVtMV65gNeogoHvboRo_YGSs1EaYmarvzT-9pPLa9g&oe=6716C087&_nc_sid=10d13b","lailatronica",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","@_peterpancomplex Zāl and Rudabeh.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 10, 2023.","(1/54) “We begin in darkness. A siren screams. The invaders come from the desert in a cloud of dust. The king gathers his army at a mountain castle. A single battle decides our fate. The battle burns, the din of drums, the clash of axes, the spark of swords. The dirt turns clay with blood. The sun goes down on a fallen flag. The day is lost. The king is gone. Our people are left defenseless. The only weapon we have left is our voice. So they come for our words. Scholars are murdered, books are burned, entire libraries are turned to dust. Until nothing remains. Not even memories of who we were. Silence. The sun comes up on a knight galloping across the land. He summons the teachers, the scholars, the authors, the thinkers. He tells them to gather the words that remain: the books, the scrolls, the letters, the verses. Everything that escaped the burning pits. Then he summons the sages. The keepers of our oldest myths, from before the written word. He copies their stories onto the page. Then when all has been gathered, all of the words, only then does he summon a poet. It had to be a poet. Because poetry is music. It sinks into the memory. And in this land of endless war, the only safe library is the memory of the people. It is said that at any given time there are one hundred thousand poets in Iran, but only one is chosen. A single poet, for a sacred mission. Put it all in a poem. Everything they’re trying to destroy. The entire story of our people. Our kings. Our queens. Our castles. Our banquets. Our songs and celebrations. Our goblets filled with wine. Our roasted kebabs. Our moonlit gardens. Our caravans of riches: silken carpets, amber, musk, goblets filled with diamonds, goblets filled with rubies, goblets filled with pearls. Our mountains. Our rivers. Our soil. Our borders. Our battles. Our crumbled castles. Our fallen flags. Our blood. Who we were. Who we were! Our culture. Our wisdom. Our choices. And our words. All of our words. Three thousand years of words, a castle of words! That no wind or rain will destroy! However long it takes, put it all in a poem. All of Iran, in a single poem. A torch to hold against the night! A voice to echo in the dark.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2202","720","1080","https://instagram.frjh4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/377470943_326427756518582_4662741121168596395_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.frjh4-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=EHK4U12MeCcQ7kNvgHVBTYS&_nc_gid=cff283b3762143ab913925ad317ff180&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBUaI7kHLLNwrgedreMqR8x6kyDctoxxnW4B9TPQoWyZg&oe=6716D4F2&_nc_sid=10d13b","@dickybabs","3189073795036952277",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18029726057498639","0","https://instagram.frjh4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/11820417_1660652267488220_1463398939_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.frjh4-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=gbzZ6wbwftYQ7kNvgHvO8xx&_nc_gid=cff283b3762143ab913925ad317ff180&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYACbQ8Zks2OnT7puGOwZDBd8xGxf9agkJfpla3dzQZG7A&oe=6716D879&_nc_sid=10d13b","kelseybabineau",,,,,,,,"0","@dickybabs","2024-06-09T23:04:00.000Z","18115098514371675","0","https://instagram.frjh4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/445192106_1143782923324179_3059490935727264306_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.frjh4-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=9k7c5Z4p0swQ7kNvgEXYS6K&_nc_gid=cff283b3762143ab913925ad317ff180&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB8V6Mn5gBIvO6jAE979Ea-ERkFE7gJ3BemEQYGM-nSIA&oe=6716DB55&_nc_sid=10d13b","l_a_l_a_x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Iran❤️","2024-05-16T05:13:46.000Z","18028960408823203","0","https://instagram.frjh4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/458967841_520265567027536_5750918285365472666_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.frjh4-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=Q71Zf_szFHsQ7kNvgGZhfQ3&_nc_gid=cff283b3762143ab913925ad317ff180&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCdWVkG7Mvha4VOoA-OeAa9guCg0CztBHZzX9Zx7BtJ2Q&oe=6716D067&_nc_sid=10d13b","love_sarajoy",,,,,,,,"0","@jennroach did you end up reading this?! 😍❤😢🔥","2024-04-04T08:36:44.000Z","18309017203131160","0","https://instagram.frjh4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/419540908_1613097949222559_7254067033262887161_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.frjh4-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=2cR8p5R-looQ7kNvgFgM5gx&_nc_gid=cff283b3762143ab913925ad317ff180&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBFFPA0DQ3WlDUe9Tg3vto_M7FSpwvq53bLIwhyDz_uSQ&oe=6716E1BD&_nc_sid=10d13b","roijamesstudio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","I look forward to all the upcoming posts from this man.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 07, 2023.","Almost one year ago today a young woman named Mahsa ‘Jina’ Amini was murdered in Iran by the oppressive religious regime that still clings to power today. Her crime was ‘not covering her hair properly’ and ‘wearing tight jeans.’ Mahsa’s act of defiance embodied a fire of resistance that burns in the heart of every Iranian. This fire will soon consume the regime. On Sunday night I will begin posting the longest story I’ve ever written. The story will begin with a single post on Sunday night. The remaining 54 chapters will be shared throughout the week. A Persian translation will be provided alongside the original. I’d like to dedicate this story to every Iranian fighting for freedom. Especially the young. Especially the women. Especially Mahsa ‘Jina’ Amini. The final chapter will be shared at midnight in Tehran on September 16th, the anniversary of Mahsa’s murder.","Photo by Humans of New York on September 07, 2023.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/376039716_3521258944795102_2560876813666396023_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=wf_QlRcXk98Q7kNvgH-AQd7&_nc_gid=2d3ab6a2680542a29fbd0539320e968f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAo0nW0cbupnHGjBkrORJhmOQ9vHtm7PVwGeMmZce6cew&oe=6716BFBC&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3186658323759558420",,,"Cw5SNygOu8U",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cw5SNygOu8U/","Photo by Humans of New York on September 07, 2023.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/375164990_1022097438799355_2238835745374419790_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=VIrvB_2kICAQ7kNvgGFeHMM&_nc_gid=2d3ab6a2680542a29fbd0539320e968f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAAIEmUQ6PdUMrLpWd0vomGRRASUNA4ihwkCRO9U87B9Q&oe=6716E89A&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3186658323751218921",,,"Cw5SNyfu67p",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cw5SNyfu67p/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"6130","1080","1080","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/376039716_3521258944795102_2560876813666396023_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=wf_QlRcXk98Q7kNvgH-AQd7&_nc_gid=2d3ab6a2680542a29fbd0539320e968f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAo0nW0cbupnHGjBkrORJhmOQ9vHtm7PVwGeMmZce6cew&oe=6716BFBC&_nc_sid=10d13b","Let’s talk about the oppressive regime of Israel.","3186658330461865863","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/376039716_3521258944795102_2560876813666396023_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=wf_QlRcXk98Q7kNvgH-AQd7&_nc_gid=2d3ab6a2680542a29fbd0539320e968f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAo0nW0cbupnHGjBkrORJhmOQ9vHtm7PVwGeMmZce6cew&oe=6716BFBC&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/375164990_1022097438799355_2238835745374419790_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=VIrvB_2kICAQ7kNvgGFeHMM&_nc_gid=2d3ab6a2680542a29fbd0539320e968f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAAIEmUQ6PdUMrLpWd0vomGRRASUNA4ihwkCRO9U87B9Q&oe=6716E89A&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18322427161194714","2","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/462815031_2276085122761790_4109903106478845312_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=ndxKsavRMDQQ7kNvgFWadlH&_nc_gid=2d3ab6a2680542a29fbd0539320e968f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDLRzQ6ZXqBQiAUSNSn_Huoyo40QdGdu5HlZIt4fJbeww&oe=6716E943&_nc_sid=10d13b","monamorad.48",,,,,,,,"0","Let’s talk about the oppressive regime of Israel.","2024-08-29T17:05:38.000Z","17943345020762197","0","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/13381416_900082940119213_1393288512_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=6mhRE2nz0y4Q7kNvgFwBB_2&_nc_gid=2d3ab6a2680542a29fbd0539320e968f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCL19jtExPa9nXOPlz4NqsPuJ5V5qgHF25FqWbvN71tnA&oe=6716E99A&_nc_sid=10d13b","meredith.tabscott",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Wow, thank you.","2024-01-07T14:00:24.000Z","18299011771125119","0","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/213847338_296500448828951_174408577979388177_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=ei1eFRpCksMQ7kNvgFyRIyf&_nc_gid=2d3ab6a2680542a29fbd0539320e968f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAkffupousOYZBX3BwyyUU1eZP802pqyiXhecMXEoHY8Q&oe=6716EE47&_nc_sid=10d13b","mseelenberger",,,,,,,,"0","Hero","2023-12-22T01:37:12.000Z","18015722533970338","4","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/461443610_1663420637552666_6346721807288178268_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=KnghYP1yNsUQ7kNvgGw08EF&_nc_gid=2d3ab6a2680542a29fbd0539320e968f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCBLqcFMv8apwTbL55UlFSERstmKv6KSdb7Be4W00yj3Q&oe=6716D481&_nc_sid=10d13b","gaptooth222",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","This is an important story, can you tell the stories of Gaza ?

The secular Mossadeq had sought to nationalize the Iranian oil industry, which had previously been controlled by Great Britain. U.S. officials, meanwhile, had feared Mossadeq might turn to the Soviet Union for aid. In 2013, the CIA released documents that publicly admitted its involvement in the 1953 coup. The coup, which reinstated the monarchy under the Western-friendly shah, eventually fueled a surge of nationalism which culminated in the 1979 Iranian Revolution.","2023-12-02T06:31:21.000Z","17842574424118693","2","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/424561166_1090680002122910_7643742875574983598_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=wtyYp-Ywb1oQ7kNvgHTa6ZB&_nc_gid=2d3ab6a2680542a29fbd0539320e968f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBWHvYQoqlfwueuVCWyJoscFksMkHUsXfnjrjW0A8wtBg&oe=6716EC07&_nc_sid=10d13b","violetas_roses",,,,,,,,"0","Why don’t you talk about the fact that the United States removed the democratically elected Iranian government and propped up the current government?","2023-12-02T06:28:52.000Z","17897618426914083","1","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/454223613_2073312813085157_4459305522973063433_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=TNSYh9h4OwQQ7kNvgEzQBs5&_nc_gid=2d3ab6a2680542a29fbd0539320e968f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDgLxl-BocG7U4qDEsHDrFBHshUAbRFSB_zH34BPiPlZQ&oe=6716DD8D&_nc_sid=10d13b","manimamiiiiii","18123849871318255","0","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/449711906_1414984242534964_6939839394315235009_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=qa6fXQ2O2kUQ7kNvgFneR0G&_nc_gid=2d3ab6a2680542a29fbd0539320e968f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBW8fAVVzCeoHweCmB_bQQ2b1Z00e17C-As7sFiTXyf4A&oe=6716C37D&_nc_sid=10d13b","irisntingz","0","@manimamiiiiii 🥺🥺🥺🥺","2023-11-17T23:58:04.000Z","1","@irisntingz","2023-11-17T23:37:53.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"353449",,,,,,,,,,"Humans of New York","242598499","humansofny",,"Cw5SN4vuAeH","2023-09-07T15:08:17.000Z","Sidecar","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cw5SN4vuAeH/",,,,

At the dinner table Mitra disagreed with everything I said. If I said ‘red,’ she said ‘green.’ If I said ‘spice,’ she said ‘sweet.’ But there was something between us. I could see it in the eyes. It was like glancing at a beautiful mountain from afar. The mountain hasn’t been experienced yet. Its cliffs have not been climbed. Its flowers have not been picked. But you are drawn to its beauty, even at a distance. On her fifteenth birthday I got her flowers. It was winter. There weren’t many flowers during winter. So I went to an Armenian flower shop and got fifteen white carnations, with one red in the center. I was shy with my words, so I wrote her a long letter. I told her the story of the female knight Gordafarid, one of the bravest champions in all of Shahnameh. Gordafarid was a master of archery. No bird could escape her arrows. And she was beautiful: her face glowed like the moon. Her waist was cypress-shaped. Her hair was worthy of a crown. I told Mitra: ‘She’s just like you. Together we can do great things for Iran!’ Mitra hid the letter from her father. One night over dinner I told him about my plans to become king. I told him that I would use my voice, and speak about 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥. Justice. He said: ‘This boy is delusional! He’s living in a thousand-year-old book!’ He told me that Iran was a constitutional monarchy. And unless I planned to lead a coup, the highest I could rise was Prime Minister. He said that Iranians were too worried about survival to care about ideals. So if I wanted to be Prime Minister, I’d need to put away childish ideas and learn about the real world. A few weeks later I joined a club of students at my school who met each week to discuss politics. It was the youth chapter of a new party called the Pan-Iranist Party. The leader of the club was a medical student from the University of Tehran. His name was Dr. Mohammadreza Ameli Tehrani. But everyone called him by his nickname: The Siren.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"103","720","1080","https://instagram.fknu1-5.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/377419578_263013980021070_6367839860755171616_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fknu1-5.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=SzsW-W9hOu8Q7kNvgFGogEb&_nc_gid=08b7813a756e410fad6b407ff3397d75&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD5lKRXd__Aa6WbE9hJOFe8PUIkfdDaBfjCVclrkjIn3g&oe=6716EBE7&_nc_sid=10d13b","@havailaharnold @dalabillss guys you must read this if you haven’t I’m only on this one but holyyyyy","3189753931956726196",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18217221922247905","1","https://instagram.fknu1-5.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/305526811_475809917735442_5121442713759643549_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fknu1-5.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=UeqhuBqbGvUQ7kNvgEJ-j9s&_nc_gid=08b7813a756e410fad6b407ff3397d75&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCo7eddKPQGhrflmZbrafegO8FyCZ8bs6oaQNmZ8v7bgg&oe=6716EEE4&_nc_sid=10d13b","laura_parent00",,,,,,,,"0","@havailaharnold @dalabillss guys you must read this if you haven’t I’m only on this one but holyyyyy","2023-09-19T13:15:09.000Z","17998768532116385","3","https://instagram.fknu1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/11327008_883078148440009_1748515612_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fknu1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=2YSSVSc1UvoQ7kNvgHd9t5b&_nc_gid=08b7813a756e410fad6b407ff3397d75&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAmUzB7_sWZXb4jjeKP1OKWVf7f9Pp8JUHiSzWCn2tWqw&oe=6716E485&_nc_sid=10d13b","nedab1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","I love that us, Armenians, are in every story!","2023-09-17T19:52:17.000Z","17997600893144843","1","https://instagram.fknu1-6.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/160876316_126637999394643_6250643974535247660_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fknu1-6.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=EZhL_1gK8HQQ7kNvgGoF5xN&_nc_gid=08b7813a756e410fad6b407ff3397d75&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCn0NZIF679A16G7QUQklp9RP7IPT_0PoQuJnX_X9XEOg&oe=6716CEC9&_nc_sid=10d13b","lady.sun.shine.here",,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2023-09-16T21:52:24.000Z","18290240206134919","4","https://instagram.fknu1-5.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/437595425_1581980172647969_8070543917149846348_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fknu1-5.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=hc0Rm4TFnuEQ7kNvgEObJwo&_nc_gid=08b7813a756e410fad6b407ff3397d75&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCpoQG5N3ZwerZcN8-mmtaRXCbugtrL-001lPr1Iyhlpw&oe=6716C9BB&_nc_sid=10d13b","karacaburcak",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Such an interesting story that it takes my breath away… As a Turkish physician, I am nowadays vey much interested in Persian history and life after 1979 … I am reading lots of books and this story is one of those that has been carves both to my heart amd brain😢😢","2023-09-16T12:03:37.000Z","18098217877348246","1","https://instagram.fknu1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/461090172_8337143223031864_7428634096479385223_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fknu1-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=wVVqF0XZODwQ7kNvgHy5OsJ&_nc_gid=08b7813a756e410fad6b407ff3397d75&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA6WziWxis_wAsQIZpX1DoCc8SZimi8S0Vph7DMB371qQ&oe=6716BE3A&_nc_sid=10d13b","missjas9","0","Her expression in that photograph","2023-09-16T02:27:43.000Z","17901976700845063","1","https://instagram.fknu1-3.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/453718759_1524396044836738_2226484813058007590_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fknu1-3.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=M6Bu7Kz7MKkQ7kNvgE1OIaB&_nc_gid=08b7813a756e410fad6b407ff3397d75&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDKiWxeSL_PAXg1Ud107Wv7Q17zZBSZ0IWYs6FIVZ7kMA&oe=6716CE6F&_nc_sid=10d13b","farinaz_",,,,,,,,"0","The single red carnation… ✨","2023-09-16T00:39:15.000Z","18016462813793557","1","https://instagram.fknu1-6.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/275109105_2093440080818247_7083090800604350964_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fknu1-6.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=iP6rAhQyHtcQ7kNvgFb-LaN&_nc_gid=08b7813a756e410fad6b407ff3397d75&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCWkA1-tob2G6uQYZn9Y0y8sIoY0RtGLw_IKT7WEmoeug&oe=6716D3EF&_nc_sid=10d13b","dalabillss",,,,,,,,"0","@laura_parent00 holy moly okay I will","2023-09-19T15:07:49.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"38656",,,,,,,,,,"Humans of New York","242598499","humansofny",,"CxESE0TL6m0","2023-09-11T21:38:41.000Z","Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxESE0TL6m0/",,,,
"Photo by Humans of New York on June 08, 2023.","“When he was born I took him see his grandfather. I brought him to the construction site where he worked, so they could meet. But my dad didn’t even make an effort. It was the same thing I remembered from my childhood. Never once do I remember: ‘Oh, let’s go to the water park.’ He’d spend all his money on friends and girls. And when he did come home he was always screaming, always hitting. For every little thing: if we didn’t brush our teeth, if we didn’t help out enough around the house. He treated my mom bad too. I tried to stop it. When I got older people would have to physically separate us. The anger is in me too. It comes from the inside. I’ll start to get mad, and suddenly it’s all over me. But whenever that starts to happen, I think: ‘I’m not going to be him. I’m not going to be him.’ I’ll walk away and calm down. Then I’ll come back and apologize. I’ll say: ‘What you did was wrong. But it was also wrong for me to speak that way. And I promise not to be like that again.’ I try to show him respect. Even though he’s a kid, he deserves the same respect as any person— even more, actually. Because an old person knows what’s going on, and he doesn’t. I always say goodnight with a kiss. And I just try to be as patient as I can. Always, always, always. I can read the way he is. Like, he doesn’t need to tell me if something is bothering him. Because I can see it in his face. He’s a super kind boy. I haven’t noticed any anger in him at all. Not at all. Sometimes I worry, that I need to push him a little harder to be tougher. Because he’s just so kind--- I mean, look at him.

I’ve cycled through all the arts and crafts already: painting, ceramics, you name it. So I wanted to try a sport. And let me tell you-- it’s a whole new level of pressure. Because there are other people involved. They told me that pickleball was a sport anyone could play. I took them at their word, and it’s been torture ever since. I started with a class at the YMCA; they advertised for people with ‘mixed abilities.’ But when they say ‘mixed,’ that means mixed with advanced people. During my first game I flew. I mean I actually flew. Balance is a big issue at my age. If you don’t balance, you fly. And I flew. The teacher said: ‘If it’s out of your range, just let it go. Let it go.’ Everyone was sympathetic. I think they were impressed I didn’t go straight home. But after the first game, you know, people have expectations. I couldn’t serve, I couldn’t return. Nobody said anything. But when there’s a bunch of stuff you’re supposed to do that you can’t do, and every time you play, your side is zero--- people start to notice. They try to act like they don’t care. But this is New York; there’s limited time on the courts. They care. So after my third game I was like: ‘see you later.’ I signed up for clinics at the rec center. Then I found a nice spot in Jersey where nobody was playing. Lots of wall. Lots of space. Perfect for me. I even got in a few serves. And that was fighting the wind, because it was right on the water. Of course as soon as I got back to the clinic, I couldn’t do it. But I’m going to keep trying. All I care about is having good form and enjoying the game. Winning isn’t important. I’m not a competitive person. But I’m the kind of ‘not competitive’ that’s not competitive because I know I’m going to lose, so you know what? Yeah, I’d like to win one. It would be nice to win a game. I just have to get through all this other stuff to get there.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"932","720","1080","https://instagram.fqnv8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/353066002_588007576520824_7139328782748789895_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fqnv8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=XLWS8LIv8asQ7kNvgENPuXj&_nc_gid=12b604bb69724cb29a75114af774db7a&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCx_9Fk7j767KmnJz4mSk-9h-UdA3x_bVzOcRSjMviflw&oe=6716D1E6&_nc_sid=10d13b","So proud of her!","3122970087367809549",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18384926200013401","1","https://instagram.fqnv8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/461701841_1073920680800411_110376616305764448_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fqnv8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=SaEabho5Z_sQ7kNvgEBW_X2&_nc_gid=12b604bb69724cb29a75114af774db7a&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDSAqLBiwHt-TNyI69kl62F_dhvm8Tr61y4nt6CF8gC9Q&oe=6716C895&_nc_sid=10d13b","brandiauriele_",,,,,,,,"0","So proud of her!","2023-10-05T16:11:35.000Z","18076769311400406","0","https://instagram.fqnv8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/72393431_1295435613968979_8719629955660513280_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fqnv8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=uetbypPn9QMQ7kNvgFzDv-N&_nc_gid=12b604bb69724cb29a75114af774db7a&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAssS1fiD9mdxq25v62X4CKbHUbzsB9kSTfTcI2_aPjog&oe=6716C983&_nc_sid=10d13b","perpetually_nomadic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Play tennis instead! 🔥","2023-09-16T05:27:19.000Z","18122401549309429","2","https://instagram.fqnv8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/459186734_1230262004782007_1179246045452036823_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fqnv8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=_sxd7Fil8PYQ7kNvgFuFADD&_nc_gid=12b604bb69724cb29a75114af774db7a&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD4ZDVOQAVmF4UMfNvMVu1giTI_JFsSP2l6L2r2IrfUtQ&oe=6716CF57&_nc_sid=10d13b","suecunyroberts",,,,,,,,"0","I love your resilience and tenacity.

"Photo by Humans of New York on June 12, 2023. Nenhuma descrição de foto disponível..","“The school wanted to create some new after-school programs. I’d run track in high school. Was I good? No. But I ran. So I volunteered to create the track program. The minimum to form a team is eight girls. Luckily I’m a cool teacher. I’m not rushing them to be grown. And I know the memes. So I had some girls who signed up just to be around me. In the end I found my eight. Nobody had any track experience. But these girls had playground reputations; they were fast. We just needed to build up our endurance. At our first practice we ran around the track one time, just to see how we were feeling. I ran out front to show them how it’s done. At one point I turn around-- I got girls walking, I got girls stopping. My goal was just to finish the season. I wanted them to learn commitment. So when they grow up they can determine their own way without somebody pushing them. We were a little nervous on the morning of our first meet. Some of us were panicky. Some of us were crying. I told them: We don’t need any MVPs. We don’t need any Rookies of The Year. Just don't stop running. No matter what—just don't stop running.’ All of them raced in different heats. Then the scores started coming in; it was like: ‘Whoa. What’s up. We winning this?’ A lot of the girls placed. Our captain Jaziah was second out of 24 girls. That was the day we became a team. I started buying Gatorade. We chose a team name. Every time I gave a suggestion, they’d be like: ‘That’s corny. That’s corny.’ They’re in that phase of like, they hate everything. But when we got to ‘Baby Got Track,’ that hit. BGT, baby. BGT. Now before every meet we do our BGT chant to give us a little bit of that braggadocious energy. These girls are committed. During the 7th grade trip to the Poconos, the BGT girls were in my cabin. We woke up an hour early, ate breakfast, brushed our teeth—then we ran track. Tomorrow is the championship. We know that we can do it and we’re gonna show that we can do it. But no matter what happens, these girls are already leaders in the middle school. Our principal has noticed the results. We’re getting brand new jerseys. And next year we’re going to have an indoor track team too.”","Photo by Humans of New York on June 12, 2023.

"Photo by Humans of New York on June 13, 2023.","“I’m starting to feel calmer about it. People separate all the time, right? Even with children; they make it work. I’m just frustrated that it was thirteen years of my life. He’s a great father. But it was thirteen years of not being loved the way I deserve. Or want, right? Or need, even. I was just too scared of doing it alone. Now the journey’s come to an end, and it’s like: ‘Wow, I’m really not who I used to be.’ I was so spontaneous, even with something as simple as driving. I used to drive all the time. I’d drive all night just to spend a day at the beach. But after we started a family, my husband drove. It was just our flow. Then it became a crutch. Then it got to the point where I couldn’t do it anymore, especially with my kids in the car. I was too scared. I’d lost that part of myself. Right before my 40th birthday we got in a big fight. It wasn’t the end; but it was close to the end. That night I bought myself a birthday present: one ticket to a resort in the Dominican Republic. Just one ticket. He’d up and leave no problem; especially if it’s work-related, right? So why not me? But right after I booked the ticket, I got so scared. I almost cancelled. But my sister was insistent. She’s a mother too; she said: ‘Stephanie, you’ve got to go. And don’t you dare take someone with you.’ It was only three nights. But when I say I smiled the whole trip, I mean it. I met so many other solo travelers. There was this old Russian woman; we saw each other everywhere. She’d float by me in the water. We took salsa classes together. She didn’t speak English, but every time she saw me she’d smile so big, like: ‘It’s you. You’re that girl.’ A few days after I came home, I was alone with the girls. My older daughter had a birthday party deep in Queens. Normally I’d have said no. Two hours on the subway; it was just too much. But I said: ‘You know what? We’re doing it.’ I booked a Zipcar. I hadn’t driven in years. I was panicking the whole time. My twelve-year-old was navigating, both of them were laughing at me. All of us were laughing the entire way. But we made it, didn’t we?

"Photo by Humans of New York on June 07, 2023.","“It started with a joke about pansexuals. Something about defending your kitchen from pansexuals. Then one of my classmates accused me of belittling them. Which turned into a bigger conversation about homophobia and racism. People began sharing their own experiences with discrimination, and honestly, a lot of it seemed overblown. It’s like: C’mon. You live on the wealthy side of town. What you’re describing sounds like an everyday disagreement between two humans, but you’re bumping it up to discrimination. That’s when people started accusing me of discrimination. I pointed out that I was Jewish. But they said my trauma was generational and not first-hand, so it didn’t count. All of it just seemed like some sort of competition. A twisted game where the more discrimination you could claim, the more social points you won. It ended up with everyone ganging up on me and calling me racist. And that started me on a journey of watching alt-right videos. It just felt good to hear people say: ‘It’s not you, it’s them. Those blue haired people, with their thirteen pronouns-- they act like they’re morally superior. But it’s all about power. They want to shame you into silence.’ The videos always used the word ‘they.’ ‘They’ are ruining this country. ‘They’ want to take away your rights. No matter how many types of people were being described, it was always ‘they.’ It made it easy for me to dismiss discrimination whenever it was claimed, by anyone. I’d think: ‘There they go again.’ I’m out of that phase now. If anything I’m politically active on the other side. I’m thankful it happened to me when I was fourteen, and still growing. Because if I’d been older, working some dead-end job, not meeting people— it would have been harder. Because one thing that really helped me was one-on-one conversations. My more moderate classmates started talking to me again. A few of them even apologized for how it all went down. They didn’t speak as a member of a group. It was just: ‘This is who I am. This is how I experienced discrimination.’ It wasn’t hostile. I didn’t feel ganged up on. And I was able to hear them. I’ve learned that for a lot of people, it’s not a game. It’s their lives.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1775","720","1080","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/352406212_1739199259831939_6743839345425737652_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=puqxpm6RTaIQ7kNvgHDK5nF&_nc_gid=7883395cfd6b421a8d43c9a9c4101271&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBJvJ5TRdwOKgsFiqmEzMV2wFrTEFD95ndwAYz6B0ghbw&oe=6716D4F7&_nc_sid=10d13b","@yuriination not really.

"Photo by Humans of New York on June 09, 2023.","“None of the decisions I made led me to fame or wealth, but they have led to really rich relationships. I just kept leaning into the people I cared about. I chose a job that allowed me to work remotely for thirty years. It allowed me to be home a lot with my wife and three daughters. Never missed a game. Never missed a school play. I picked them up from school every day at 3:30, unless I was travelling. I wasn’t a road warrior or anything. I only travelled a handful of days every month. And whenever I had to catch an early morning train to meet a client out of town, I’d be doing this calculus: I have to do this now, so that we can be together later. They were always my first priority. And they still are. We don’t get to see each other as much. But I get this warmth every day when they ping me and tell me they’re doing something. And it goes both ways. I gave a speech for work the other day. It went really well. And they were all excited to hear about it; high fives and cheers all around. This morning I had a little time between meetings. I was sitting at a little bistro, and I had a little virtual lunch with my daughter who lives in Paris. She was making dinner there. And we had a little chat. No other description necessary, right? It was wonderful. I just feel incredibly lucky that I get to do those things—and that they still want to do it. They still want to spend time with me. Maybe because they trust me. I try to be supportive and non-judgmental. But I think it’s mainly because I was so involved with their daily lives: all those plays, all those practices, all those trips home from school. That’s a lot of conversations. It really accumulates over the years. I really got to know them.

"Photo by Humans of New York on June 10, 2023.","“I was walking down Broadway with my friend from China. Everyone kept waving at me, and saying: ‘Hi John, Hi John.’ And my friend said: ‘Wow. Everyone knows you!’ I said: ‘C’mon. That’s an exaggeration.’ Right then the door to the Imperial Theatre opened up, and it was an actor friend. He gave me the biggest hug. I said: ‘OK, maybe it’s not an exaggeration.’ Everyone does know me. I’ve been dancing for almost seventy years. It didn’t run in my family. My father was a subway motorman. But when I was sixteen I signed up for lessons with a famous Russian ballet dancer. She was a little lady; told me that I danced like a lobster. Not exactly encouraging, but when I came down the stairs after my first lesson, Eartha Kitt was waiting in the lobby. Not that she was waiting for me; it was for someone else. But I saw it as a sign. I thought: ‘I’m on my way.’ A few months later I made my debut dancing to bagpipes at the Scottish Highland Festival. Then after that I got a gig at the Wine and Cheese Festival. And I never stopped. I wasn’t good enough to do it full time. I had to work as a Spanish teacher for thirty-three years. I was competent; my kids did well on the tests. But I wouldn’t say I was beloved. And when your name is Mr. Bate, the kids are going to call you Masturbate. It’s unavoidable. But each day when that 2:42 bell rang after eighth period; I got on a train and headed to my second life. I’ve danced it all. I was a flamenco dancer. I learned Afro-Haitian, Afro-Cuban, Afro-Brazilian. I danced in the Sambadrome during Carnival. I danced with an Appalachian clogging company. I’ve danced in every major theater on Broadway. My specialty was screwing up the choreography. I’ve actually heard audience members say: ‘Oh no, not him again.’ But I always figured out a way to work. I’ve played every kind of character role. I’ve played Von Rothbart, the evil Magician. I’ve played Nutcracker. But the role I loved best was Handsome Haldor. He was a total flop.

"Photo by Humans of New York on June 05, 2023.","“I never go in for the kill. I know what I look like. I’ve been 6’4” since I was nineteen. When a guy my size makes a move, it can be frightening. So I let the woman lead. I know that when she’s ready, she’ll let me know. She’ll give me the cues. Only when that happens will I pull out the magic wand. This is important. I always ask: ‘If you had a magic wand, what would be your perfect man?’ I let them tell me how they want to be treated. And then I follow instructions. I can’t tell you how many women have told me: ‘Wow. You don’t go down on me like a guy.’ Most men just put their whole face in it. Way too much. Especially if there’s stubble involved. I’d personally recommend shaving your face right beforehand. Shave that shit down until it feels like a baby’s ass. If you’re not gonna do that, at the very least you’ve got to lead with the lips. Use the tongue gently. And don’t go straight for the clitoris. Aim for one o’clock. You can’t go wrong with one o’clock. But don’t just park at one o’clock. Travel around. The entire area is sensitive. With men it’s all about the penis. But with women-- it’s all about everything. Except the butthole. This one is so important. The balloon knot is not for you to touch. Ever, not even once. Unless you’re asked. Even then there’s got to be preparation unless you want the whole house smelling like baby diapers. So always ask. Always, always ask. Ask if she’s comfortable with fingers. Ask if she’s comfortable with penetration. Ask if she’s into verbal. A lot of women don’t want to hear a fucking word. It scares them. So you better ask. Also— and this one might be surprising-- a lot of women don’t want to go face-to-face. If you’re kissing them, or being too intimate, they might lock up. They’ll make it very clear that the intimacy scares them. It’s a heartbreaking thing, because it usually means there’s been some trauma. If that happens, just stop. Stop everything and hold them. Don’t ask them to explain, unless they choose to tell you. Just hold them. Maybe the sex will come later when they’re more comfortable. Maybe it never comes at all. And that’s fine.

"Photo by Humans of New York on June 19, 2023.","“Everybody gets butt hurt over words. The ‘Me Too’ movement was necessary. That was good. But then it just turned into everybody getting way too sensitive. You’ve got these people trying to create a bubble-wrapped world where they’re never going to hear a word that hurts them. Just so they can always be comfortable. It’s human nature to want to be comfortable. No problem with that. But if something makes you uncomfortable, you don’t get to make a rule that the rest of the world can’t say it. I give it another two or three years. There’s no way it can last. It’s happened over and over again throughout history: people get soft, then they get hard again. Just wait until the next really deep recession. It’s going to seem pretty self-indulgent to obsess over other people’s words. People are going to get strong again. And that’s good. I like strong people. It’s not that I dislike weak people. I just like strong people more. I was with my friend Christina the other day. She had her little boy with her, and she’s letting this kid run into everything. He’s running into things with his face and his head and his body. And Christina is letting him, because Christina knows. She went to state, she went to nationals. She almost became a professional softball player. Christina knows what it takes. And she doesn’t want her kid to be soft. That’s what I like. I like people who don’t want a trophy just for showing up. I like people who can hear a joke, or even an insult. If the words aren’t true then they shouldn’t bother you. But if the words are true— they should sting. Don’t hide from the sting. Embrace the sting. Feel the sting of the words and say: ‘I don’t like this.’ So I’m going to become a better version of myself-- mentally, emotionally, spiritually, physically-- until the words don’t sting anymore. Don’t hate yourself. Never hate yourself. Just hate the person that allowed you to become what you were, before ten seconds ago. Before you felt the sting. That person is disgusting. That person is unacceptable. That person must be destroyed.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"6146","720","1080","https://scontent-jnb2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/355102164_867567491774849_1326476327886879648_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-jnb2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=bRVE05QDUWIQ7kNvgHBeJKC&_nc_gid=3da0314507d34c0e8396387e5b5e8af8&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAvXMzrUj0SbTAUtn7qlIx1nLkN_NF8ZVArvQzq5_Oykw&oe=6716E5C6&_nc_sid=10d13b","I’m all about the #mefirst movement ;)","3128717670685299494",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18331102045126173","0","https://scontent-jnb2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/462450269_546579754520437_5314921840547503375_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-jnb2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=lalB_f7QWwoQ7kNvgGvWrly&_nc_gid=3da0314507d34c0e8396387e5b5e8af8&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDmczQR8EVvpGTwUwEXG0f_w8s3v9vTkyMHQecH2bqiVA&oe=6716B902&_nc_sid=10d13b","tarushkacreations",,,,,,,,"0","I’m all about the #mefirst movement ;)","2024-07-26T23:33:18.000Z","17927835227786773","2","https://scontent-jnb2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/461693917_901731771850667_1863355124664163295_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-jnb2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=r9WMDHgI1XoQ7kNvgFYujgw&_nc_gid=3da0314507d34c0e8396387e5b5e8af8&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDFD6oEsXqcxuqt2CFvF9KZr93ASyQP106w25c7VNv9SA&oe=6716C2DA&_nc_sid=10d13b","_gammeter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","He’s right.","2024-05-28T07:25:51.000Z","18074368153552567","0","https://scontent-jnb2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/340154798_1278815006177733_3425552424814361296_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-jnb2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=K55LGvsvqE4Q7kNvgGdBWJv&_nc_gid=3da0314507d34c0e8396387e5b5e8af8&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCI1VyD6pnff4s6jJXdf-6nUF4e1pr-M1dS0SzcU4E6tw&oe=6716EEE0&_nc_sid=10d13b","dampiera",,,,,,,,"0","@mslondonlovee agreed.

Trouble is, the people in charge are racists, misogynists, and bigots. So naturally they don’t see anything wrong with our history of slavery and no need to discuss how that history continues to oppress people today.","2024-09-08T03:07:35.000Z","17843335821308388","1","https://scontent-jnb2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/462679718_775279708001835_5086450399884122350_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-jnb2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=rg_fQXLZtlcQ7kNvgEmfHAd&_nc_gid=3da0314507d34c0e8396387e5b5e8af8&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDzxPmoVwgvfiykMqMvTQpY3G-XfLdf0FxSTmqcCUuoUQ&oe=6716DB3A&_nc_sid=10d13b","mslondonlovee",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","@dampiera Laura thank you, we need more people like you in this world, people who actually want change and who actually see people as human beings.

When I walk home and my husband is there and he's so happy to see me. I was really hesitant about getting married. My parents had a bad marriage. So my husband had to talk me into it. And I mean, he had to really push. But it’s been 40 years, and it gets better all the time. Because you grow closer together when you go through things. You understand each other more. I'll tell you some basic things about him. He's very, very bright. He’s always reading. He’s always learning new things and he loves to share them with me. He gets really happy when I’m happy. That’s really a big deal, you know? I mean; it really makes him happy. When I’m happy. You can see it.  Just the way he looks at me. Other people can see it, but I can certainly see it. And I can feel it. He really cares, you know? That’s not something you can just put on. I'll give you an example. It was very hard for me to get pregnant. And when our son Brian was born, he was less than three pounds. Went down to two and a half pounds. And Paul was at the hospital every day. By my side the whole time. Every single moment; it was just like absolutely unbelievable. I didn’t have to ask him: can you be there? He was just there. Because he cared. Not everyone has that. I'm really very fortunate. I have someone who cares.

"Photo by Humans of New York on June 05, 2023. لا يتوفر وصف للصورة..","“I’m basically a big butch lesbian. I hosted lesbian parties for ten years. And let me tell you— they adore me. A lot of my closest friends are big butch lesbians. Certainly my best bodybuilding partners: amazing, aggressive, powerful women. Very dominant over the males in the gym. Not dominant over me, of course. Unless they’re busting my balls, because strong women are ball busters. They're just like the dudes. They are the dudes. They just happen to be dudes that are dudettes. They understand both sides of the fence; which is why we get along so well. Don’t get me wrong—I’m still friends with a lot of ‘dude’ dudes. But a lot of guys are just too rough around the edges when it comes to women. I don’t want any part of it. I find it grotesque. One term I’ve been hearing these last couple years is ‘body count.’ I’ve heard men say: ‘What’s her body count?’ They’re referring to the amount of people a woman has been with. What a pathetic, disgusting, wormy question. How dare you? This is an independent soul. This is a human that needs to be treated with honor and respect. This isn’t some piece of property you can put in a box. Imagine thinking someone is not worthy of you because they were a little experimental when they were younger, or even when they were older. That’s their choice. Leave them alone.  A woman can be with whoever she wants, whenever she wants, however she wants. If you ask me, it all comes down to insecurity. A lot of men think: ‘If she’s had a lot of lovers, there will definitely have been somebody better than me.’ They feel threatened, and they try to make that the woman’s problem. What a sad way of viewing things. No matter how many lovers a person has had, they’ll have never been with another you. Every person comes to the table with what they bring to the table. All of us are exactly what we are—different. And that what makes us all so special.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"4088","720","1080","https://instagram.fruh4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/352200834_749780603497046_7163654487475651254_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fruh4-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=DVNYL7YGEAAQ7kNvgEwoWEZ&_nc_gid=1a08765ec03e4df89829aa0bdfe61efa&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAvsOWPAdgqepPxQIb5ZjdrfyCSiHkU--2o60YyKvsBMg&oe=6716D176&_nc_sid=10d13b","what’s it gonna play WOAH","3118533196827846662",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18032330488765135","1","https://instagram.fruh4-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/451833067_848428756743245_2486427793683769947_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fruh4-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=1JRtF3NBZm4Q7kNvgHedoGI&_nc_gid=1a08765ec03e4df89829aa0bdfe61efa&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAo1ZqtWkaaOVRYxJkOo8jMqzhSWsC90q3agFGu5n8FBA&oe=6716BC67&_nc_sid=10d13b","peters_.xo",,,,,,,,"0","what’s it gonna play WOAH","2024-01-19T18:51:34.000Z","18017635543914109","0","https://instagram.fruh4-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/10499136_1634500443489259_13744574_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fruh4-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=pcTGjc4rFQoQ7kNvgFBqSKA&_nc_gid=1a08765ec03e4df89829aa0bdfe61efa&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCT9XXh5VbhqvSx4o3F1FN6eTGXIwpU0mymReFB1qcdNQ&oe=6716E5E6&_nc_sid=10d13b","chadsaville",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","He's got that big pick me energy","2023-11-25T17:37:44.000Z","18037945234640946","0","https://instagram.fruh4-3.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/12751199_501052943413743_103196273_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fruh4-3.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=7IVhRWiuty0Q7kNvgF0TWQ0&_nc_gid=1a08765ec03e4df89829aa0bdfe61efa&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAh2fWOi_lRoLztEi6oRb6iP1kiwk6go5NTkHsrQ2F2cw&oe=6716E0CB&_nc_sid=10d13b","andrashamim",,,,,,,,"0","@kavehthegreat08 only prostitution if you agreed to pay before hand 😂😂","2024-01-10T23:39:18.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"262736",,,,,,,,,,"Humans of New York","242598499","humansofny",,"CtHQWt5L-gG","2023-06-05T15:15:48.000Z","Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CtHQWt5L-gG/",,,,

"Photo by Humans of New York on June 01, 2023.","“You don’t want them to grow up materialistic, but it’s all around them. You try to keep their self-esteem high. Let them have the latest clothes, a decent phone. But that costs money.  I spend a lot more time making it than spending it. They say it's 40 hours but it’s really 60 hours. It takes an hour to get up, an hour to get to work, then you take your hour to get home. Once you’re home you get to spend a little time, watch a little TV, kiss, go to sleep. That’s 5 days a week. Then on the weekends you’re tired, but you try your best to do something memorable. Because disappointing your kids is one of the most painful things-- period. We just played basketball for these two prizes; my son will remember that. But blink your eyes and the weekend’s over. And it starts all over again. It’s the matrix. If I’d bought bitcoin ten years ago, or my stock portfolio was rolling in, I’d be doing two things right now: exercising, and spending time with my family. That's it. They say money doesn’t buy happiness, but it sure would help.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"991","719","1080","https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/350584625_917472759312743_3333396492334660729_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=CV2b0BRUJaYQ7kNvgHA7yFA&_nc_gid=7d63fae4869c4ad097bbd8c2e6e4eb73&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB-iZj1q33uK1J4urehfx3yFJHeGvzx9qHzRe8eABER9A&oe=6716D995&_nc_sid=10d13b","This

"Photo by Humans of New York on June 04, 2023. Aucune description de photo disponible..","“His mother wanted a break. You know, it’s hectic. She’s a single mother. She just bought a house. It’s a lot taking care of a kid on your own. She thought maybe it would be a good experience for him to come live with Uncle Olasegun for the summer. As soon as she suggested it, I was like: ‘I want to do this.’ And here’s the reason: she did the exact same thing for me. We lost our mom when we were kids. I was really young at the time— like three. Whitney was twelve or thirteen. She and my other sister ended up taking care of me: cooked for me, took me to school, made sure I had a shower, brushed my teeth. Back then I thought she was annoying, because of my ignorance. But now it’s crazy for me to think about. It must have been such a burden. She’d be hanging out with her friends, and I was always there. So I’m just trying to pay it forward. I picked him up from the airport last night. I have no idea how the summer is going to go. I like to cook, so I’ll cook for him. Maybe we’ll paint a little in the evenings. I’m going to teach him some kickboxing on the terrace; hopefully that’ll tire him out so that I can get some work done. I’d love to be a father one day when I find the right woman. So it’s going to be a good test for me. I’m just hoping he has fun. And when he goes back home, he tells his mother all about the amazing summer he had with his uncle.”","Photo by Humans of New York on June 04, 2023.

"Photo by Humans of New York on May 26, 2023.","“God is not friend. God is king. God is master. But I love my life. I have everything I need. This is life I want. Some people are slave to phone. I am slave to God. Other people change their God every day, like socks. When God stops working for them, they try a new one. But our God never changes. That’s the difference. But that’s OK. Everyone can believe what they want. We’re not looking for people to come to us. Who will come will come. But I know the truth. That’s why I study Torah all day long. In the Torah, God says: ‘Want to connect with me? Follow my law. If not, we’re not connected.’ That’s it. It’s not a game. Other people my age go out, drink, fight, do other stuff. That is like animal. And people do it because they have no law to stop them. Torah gives me rules to be a man. Follow God, help other people, especially Jewish people. There is no right or left. There is only what needs to be done. There is only Torah. And after this world comes the next. You work good this month, the paycheck will be good. Right? If you follow the law in this world—there’s nothing to worry about. If you don’t follow the law, well-- it’s not a game.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2302","720","1080","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/348768221_200222352956021_5481979488271765779_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=D5JsgLPs4IsQ7kNvgEWUYUP&_nc_gid=b32fff2a0c7249198c7524c3451d9fda&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCzb15TA9nI-Unry0bstFUF8z9s2tmXxIsB34cWRCXCew&oe=6716C5F5&_nc_sid=10d13b","#freepalestine #savepalestine #stopthegenocideingaza","3111338149292968740",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18202336045282454","6","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/391264958_6630191567049260_6027474233056897915_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=gxVpc5lLuEgQ7kNvgFLBtuP&_nc_gid=b32fff2a0c7249198c7524c3451d9fda&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBhKYgJYZVSxA2RvuflYA62Vs9dqI3a8Zkj-ae36I-ofQ&oe=6716BC34&_nc_sid=10d13b","ittech_ny",,,,,,,,"0","#freepalestine #savepalestine #stopthegenocideingaza","2023-11-07T19:51:14.000Z","18000492757954064","4","https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/101384418_3544716902209093_2996122014063788032_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=E4epg0ryliYQ7kNvgFv2l2b&_nc_gid=b32fff2a0c7249198c7524c3451d9fda&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBfyNrz5BB3pive8AkqGsDdhso51fCC5vvNGdjOrQouHA&oe=6716DE47&_nc_sid=10d13b","tee_santana",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","I don't understand why some people on here are claiming that he fosters an anti-Judiasm community.

In a casino some of the smartest people in the world are doing everything to keep you gambling. They’ve taken the clocks off the wall. They’re pumping in oxygen. They’ve even thought about the patterns on the carpet. Everything has been scientifically engineered to keep you pulling that lever. And that’s our entire world now. It’s one big casino where some of the smartest people in the world are asking themselves: ‘What is the best way I can get people to eat more? What is the best way I can get people to watch more pornography? Or take more pills? How can I use artificial intelligence to serve people the exact succession of sixty second videos that will keep them staring at their screen for an entire day?’ I used to be a personal responsibility guy. A big reason for that is I have insane discipline. If I needed to completely stop eating candy for ten years, I could do it. Done. So if I ever saw someone who was obese, I’d think— I could do it. Put me in the exact same situation, and I’d lose the weight. But now whenever I see an obese person on the jogging trail, I just want to give them a hug. It’s almost enough to make me cry. I think God—this must be so fucking hard for you. And it’s going to take perfection: insane discipline, and time, and money, and listening to all the right podcasts. Every day of the week needs to be perfectly regimented. Five years of absolute perfection. That’s what it’s going to take. Because a ton of the smartest people in the world are getting paid massive amounts of money to figure out a way to make you fail.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3434","720","1080","https://instagram.fuio10-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/351014966_1699053413924082_7389483094411997517_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fuio10-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=h6gIaAjV-1cQ7kNvgH1Mv45&_nc_gid=2c1e0d0ccfb84e7ca2b6bcc4511139a6&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAdmyZQhF2EhAOZVPvHwJFLJ1NIqb3cdmCmoTRFLSGOoQ&oe=6716EA08&_nc_sid=10d13b","Brother’s right","3116432464495171232",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18020432246375373","0","https://instagram.fuio10-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/463404791_1091905248954178_1383230893424055636_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fuio10-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=tLOT9VGRvNsQ7kNvgGuFBK_&_nc_gid=2c1e0d0ccfb84e7ca2b6bcc4511139a6&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCA6CZzsu5NAbZ1pil48pPMfg9SCCGyJacboB07pRIDTA&oe=6716DAC5&_nc_sid=10d13b","wind__falls",,,,,,,,"0","Brother’s right","2024-07-25T21:53:31.000Z","17990828624469108","0","https://instagram.fuio10-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/101384418_3544716902209093_2996122014063788032_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fuio10-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=E4epg0ryliYQ7kNvgHOzO5r&_nc_gid=2c1e0d0ccfb84e7ca2b6bcc4511139a6&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDhbjgd4z3UWpX3TkQ062-unAq8lfFJpreXcV0umBxxUA&oe=6716DE47&_nc_sid=10d13b","tee_santana",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","He's right.

"Photo by Humans of New York on May 31, 2023.","“It’s not too different from when you make a playlist for someone you love. Every lyric, every note, you wanted them to hear. You wanted them to know something. It’s a deep thing. If you tried to say it, it’d be excruciating. But you want them to feel it. It’s the same when you’re writing a song. The first song I ever wrote was in this park. I was thirteen. It was me and two other girls. We jumped the fence and sat on the grass and wrote in the sunshine. We made a rule that we wouldn’t write about boys, so the song was called: Not To Write About Boys. We thought it turned out awesome. And two days later we played our first show in this same park. I couldn’t play for shit back then, but I never looked back. Music gave me this mountain to climb that didn’t have a limit. Some years I’d spend almost 200 days on the road. I got to headline Webster Hall last year with my current band; it was a huge highlight of my life. Writing a song feels a little different now; it can be easy to get caught up in the pressure: the deadlines, the expectations, what people think. One wrong word and it becomes too cheesy, or too cool. The only way I know how to do it is to write for the fan in myself. That’s my compass. There’s a songwriter in me that writes the song, but I listen as a fan. Both parts have to weigh in, but the fan gets the final vote. When the fan inside me says: ‘I get that. I feel that. It makes me so fucking happy.’ Then I know I finally got it. That’s when I know it’s done.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"311","719","1080","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/350442925_637175614952293_847504208569067254_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=gsOsMlLZNskQ7kNvgGJOhjx&_nc_gid=0abbb425697944edb83b75cf9786d489&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAaHzHeImHMQFjKwcPYPi560Wka7Aqi2KPkTbzJyAtSHQ&oe=6716E4E2&_nc_sid=10d13b","❤️","3115034565668355866",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18086152780329905","0","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/368132765_675063820809728_7927904748449051654_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=JmWZ_LqjDV8Q7kNvgFNydsF&_nc_gid=0abbb425697944edb83b75cf9786d489&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBp7e4CBuBSjma6-6cnx0xxE3tNEgE3UBOPfXcjwzxwlA&oe=6716C300&_nc_sid=10d13b","jennifercray30",,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2023-07-29T01:15:56.000Z","18026646994535404","1","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/352780721_266082989424411_3409494104960433721_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=S39WH1AVoasQ7kNvgFNZs3R&_nc_gid=0abbb425697944edb83b75cf9786d489&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBErdXRrG-REnzsU2oVCKcX4hC_hHlUtxFIqcgnNad6Tg&oe=6716D206&_nc_sid=10d13b","elon_musk_official_3130",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥","2023-06-12T11:36:22.000Z","17943490016646873","0","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/336255691_124328193803711_7710446829473315566_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=T_ztC8W15RkQ7kNvgGdp4BZ&_nc_gid=0abbb425697944edb83b75cf9786d489&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD2VaSmrkMzDBNUdBrlgb5QdWppXv3viEJscwIecV35bg&oe=6716D413&_nc_sid=10d13b","secretsofafoodie",,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2023-06-11T19:04:03.000Z","17878709906891705","0","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/288977774_557970769041005_4126274250413016518_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=W1zUvb7Pdd8Q7kNvgGJmQUh&_nc_gid=0abbb425697944edb83b75cf9786d489&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBmo3OfFyPE7_HSYUIS4whUMZkwJOVw1ln_4yYXVka8nQ&oe=6716C531&_nc_sid=10d13b","aprylmillerart",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","@talulahpaisley","2023-06-08T06:50:05.000Z","17976978584472901","0","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/11055481_804150619640822_1757241518_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=ySWIIj-vOj4Q7kNvgGfj51c&_nc_gid=0abbb425697944edb83b75cf9786d489&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDPTtCnMuSO4ZEbxrwvNDjhm7HzKp2_Z5MZnMMtRD-Frw&oe=6716D153&_nc_sid=10d13b","tdirgins","0","Saw Sunflower Bean open for the Pixies a few years back and they absolutely blew them away.

And that’s when I began to tell myself a story: ‘You’re just as good as anyone else, or even better. You deserve everything you want.’ It was a bit egotistical. But it was the story I needed back then. I needed a story to make me feel enthusiastic, to make me fight. I came to the city at the age of 22; it was a perfect time to be in the New York City jazz scene. I got to sing on stage with Dizzy Gillespie, Joe Williams, Betty Carter. I ended up falling in love with another jazz singer. We became a duet, had some success, raised our children on the road. But then we fell apart, and so did our careers. I was never able to build it back to what it had been. Now I’m watching my kids succeed more than me. It makes me feel like I did my job as a mother: I was able to pass down everything I know. But it can be painful, too. Because they’re doing everything I desired most: they’re on stage, sharing their talents, being recognized. There’s a voice inside me that says: ‘You deserve that too. There’s still time. You can still do that.’ But that’s not the story I need to tell myself anymore. I don’t need a story to help me fight. I need a story to help me feel good in the moment. There’s this more mature part of me that says: Relax. You did a good job. You did a lot of stuff. The earth life only offers so many types of experiences. And I got to play so many parts: I got to be a singer, yes. But also the faithful daughter, the free-spirited girl who went off to explore the world, the pot-smoking hippie, the wild woman, the fool, the lover, the wife, the scorned woman, and the giving mother. Now I feel like I’m getting back to the Kim I was when I was five, before the story began: joking around, singing to my cat, singing to people on the street. Being happy for everyone else. Not worrying about getting ahead. Believing everything is going to work out. And that I’m exactly where I was always supposed to be.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1009","720","1080","https://scontent-eze1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/350092155_967347487793375_1818734966040224629_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-eze1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=dg3b8-sY3bkQ7kNvgGHEAiR&_nc_gid=2ce5ab699a2c4bfc9b8f6accdaa27d81&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYABYuFiQYQxNSDfsrq4wV7vfEDtuRM_YfG1u6ufEDSYKQ&oe=6716ECCE&_nc_sid=10d13b","Woooow","3113662299297959992",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18015575504424650","0","https://scontent-eze1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/463404791_1091905248954178_1383230893424055636_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-eze1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=tLOT9VGRvNsQ7kNvgFaa_GO&_nc_gid=2ce5ab699a2c4bfc9b8f6accdaa27d81&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA8MdfMKUrNJ4ZVbG9FQR2RDwTnPFaf8ub2pKWe51u5dg&oe=6716DAC5&_nc_sid=10d13b","wind__falls",,,,,,,,"0","Woooow","2024-07-25T21:50:32.000Z","17946949970804701","1","https://scontent-eze1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/348337308_171191959245925_8493937263996176373_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-eze1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=gzA2Pleb_-MQ7kNvgFgVAlu&_nc_gid=2ce5ab699a2c4bfc9b8f6accdaa27d81&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBKyLYrSVvcj7h0SNF_ndV8OhkzsEBRGoo0ZeQ6AqFYKA&oe=6716E9A6&_nc_sid=10d13b","marybankswow",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","I missed this the first time @kimkalesti .

"Photo by Humans of New York on May 28, 2023.","“Motherhood is not that hard. Times get hard, financially. But the rest I’ve got in the bag. It’s the post-partum that hit me more than motherhood. But I have to get up and fight through it, every day. I organized all this myself. I want her to know that she has people here who love her. I grew up hard, honestly. I struggled. My mom was there-- but she wasn’t there. She was young, she was partying, she was never home. I can only remember having one birthday party; at the skating rink. So that’s why every birthday is important to me. I want her to remember this. I want her to remember every birthday.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"429","719","1080","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/349439501_803036118105967_8734072200848343365_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=2eDguXcUpy4Q7kNvgHxG0Lx&_nc_gid=74bae515c8c84e22abebe8f90a16117c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAQOxpCfAKVJMvh48S_bsY3owcdaa6vpOUuk_lIVAcn0A&oe=6716D1FB&_nc_sid=10d13b","Excuse me there is a faute d’orthographe « hits me »","3112786802863834784",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18013904984221775","1","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/451306030_1175009406879118_1331309086270515587_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=JUjeCkpSyNsQ7kNvgH0NirS&_nc_gid=74bae515c8c84e22abebe8f90a16117c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA1UKGeT2tPaNbnZLcYewCgOifHacId2wAZ0fbO64_WOA&oe=6716C361&_nc_sid=10d13b","olivia_cdrt",,,,,,,,"0","Excuse me there is a faute d’orthographe « hits me »","2024-03-26T11:24:58.000Z","18037986859476460","0","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/462084440_1049796803471075_2001380742930915676_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=dkOVw6QdPugQ7kNvgEGpqRs&_nc_gid=74bae515c8c84e22abebe8f90a16117c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB6wMSI5gJ89Ut_gtw0ckFzYNYPxxKV4qIh1MhzGQ47ew&oe=6716C7DF&_nc_sid=10d13b","lorneroestorf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","You GO mama!

"Photo by Humans of New York on May 24, 2023.","“It was Day 15 of COVID. I’d been eating Wendy’s for 14 days straight. Bacon whatever-the-hell-it-is. A lot of good hot cheesy nastiness. I was starting to feel it, bad. It was like: ‘I gotta move.’ Plus I wanted to let people know: ‘This is New York. We’re not going anywhere.’ Hand truck came from Home Depot. Got the dual 15-inch speakers at a really good electronics store in the Bronx. It’s called ‘Going Out of Business.’ That’s not the name, but they’ve had that sign in the window for twelve years. Corner of 3rd Ave and 149th. Tell them Love Train sent you. I can go about eight miles before I run out of charge. You gotta be respectful above 59th Street. A lot of elderly people up there. They’ve got sensitive hearing, so you’ve got to be mindful. Normally I’ll play Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, Elton John-- all the old good stuff. But after 59th there’s no limits. That’s when the city kicks in. Anything goes: disco, hip hop, house. I’m competing with the sirens and trucks, so the louder the better. This set-up is 4th generation. The 3rd generation had lights and a television attached, but she’s currently in the custody of Miami PD. I’m gonna get her back, though. They gave me a good judge. She knew that Love Train is not a criminal. And spreading love is not a crime.”","Photo by Humans of New York on May 24,

Sometimes when a person gets what they need, the smile goes away.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"638","720","1080","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/350246674_2032911747040667_3423750460233369441_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=E-9nvQnB37sQ7kNvgHUSngL&_nc_gid=d058247265e34fdcb699dcd0b6ed6eb7&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDNKLDcuMdeL-mTnBS6AWDEyYm_0DB-Hkc-x2tpW_mqKg&oe=6716CF9F&_nc_sid=10d13b","You should come to Miami !","3114388669594522888",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17947171460623684","0","https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/12930945_1725119804375132_42861034_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=_0QXr72gXWIQ7kNvgHIsgEP&_nc_gid=d058247265e34fdcb699dcd0b6ed6eb7&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC121-Eio27N-TB9gejgrcxGy7T3bFB863ZAi3waNFiQg&oe=6716BFE9&_nc_sid=10d13b","_saschie_",,,,,,,,"0","You should come to Miami !","2023-11-22T00:50:15.000Z","17991019262336926","0","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/458165663_1554518045142557_1930659480238516893_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=xkPqS0KRPiwQ7kNvgH8y5Ur&_nc_gid=d058247265e34fdcb699dcd0b6ed6eb7&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYATt4DZy06mo-v5FlP22iTE0waaNmaNRDMKM0_5Ouhnew&oe=6716ECBB&_nc_sid=10d13b","perlacelestestyles",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","You got that right😮😢","2023-09-17T01:01:25.000Z","17973266912379957","0","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/353432098_254169267261581_7179662304022130581_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=WXKXiXRy-T4Q7kNvgE4Oz44&_nc_gid=d058247265e34fdcb699dcd0b6ed6eb7&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDAu5QwtWxALG4SOrXiUDYWAunXguf46bDuGO5bw22eKw&oe=6716D15E&_nc_sid=10d13b","newyork._.communit.1",,,,,,,,"0","paypal.me/SGoswami182","2023-06-14T14:20:25.000Z","18013874128583524","1","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/461162336_873534461582819_5653317360862252274_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=oyjIcWOlOlQQ7kNvgHrjFsh&_nc_gid=d058247265e34fdcb699dcd0b6ed6eb7&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCglBnyHtuy7lSq3fDU8ol6IVGNMBtXYBPBTVaX4-sCzA&oe=6716BA56&_nc_sid=10d13b","melissaragoo82",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","He’s such an amazing person and doorman.

I went straight to the self-published stuff the authors were selling for nothing. A lot of it was Romance. I read stuff my eleven-year-old self should not have been reading. But my favorite was called The ABCs of Kissing Boys. I read it multiple times. It’s about a girl who’s never been kissed. She falls in love with the next-door neighbor. She’d grown up with him. But one day she looked up, and he was different. And he was there. It gave me hope. I’d never been one who was sought after. I’d get these big, all-encompassing crushes. And they’d always just devastate me. But when I read these books, it was like: I can be her. It can happen. I fell in love with Romance. I even wrote my college thesis on it. There are a few rules every Romance must follow. Rule number one: it has to be about the romance. The book could be set in outer space. But it’s not about space exploration. It’s about two people who fall in love. Toward the end there will always be some sort of fight, or miscommunication. That’s the thrill of it. But it’s also the hardest part to do successfully. Because in the back of their mind, the reader knows. Rule number two: every Romance has a happy ending. Right now I’m still in my first act. A small-town girl moves to New York. She hasn’t found her dream job yet at a Romance publisher. But she’s working at an academic publisher, so she’s in the solar system. On weekends she works at a bookstore called Books Are Magic. Maybe one day, somebody will walk in. Boy, girl, doesn’t matter. They’ll buy her favorite book. Then they’ll keep coming back to buy the books she recommends. She’ll become the first person they text whenever they want to chat. She loves Corgis. So whenever they see a Corgi, they’ll text her a picture. There will be fights. Because this girl has never been able to stand up for herself. But she’ll feel safe with them, so she’ll stand up for herself. She won’t be made fun of. Or judged. She can say the most inane things. Every time she finishes a book, she can talk about it for hours. And they’ll be charmed. They’ll never say: ‘My God. It’s the same plot over and over.’”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1990","720","1080","https://instagram.flad2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/348839734_587301833499989_2009599617243533977_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.flad2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=o3ISl16jdEQQ7kNvgESlrKN&_nc_gid=18eb1cfcc845414d98e1e6c7997cdc03&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAR0BEDzYjJE_6Ty7FFsUEmH_88BIJAsWPgOWhbIOKyvQ&oe=6716CBF2&_nc_sid=10d13b","😍","3109191039810375870",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18049523428810371","0","https://instagram.flad2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/463404791_1091905248954178_1383230893424055636_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.flad2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=tLOT9VGRvNsQ7kNvgEGYKeZ&_nc_gid=18eb1cfcc845414d98e1e6c7997cdc03&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDPefeLjevB4JqHDuaFQD9Nxkuy51Yg7lpgt7XYbuI8JQ&oe=6716DAC5&_nc_sid=10d13b","wind__falls",,,,,,,,"0","😍","2024-07-25T21:47:41.000Z","18032471503845352","0","https://instagram.flad2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/327700204_840860683679395_3650251671994436419_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.flad2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=_4jVQYsBV24Q7kNvgEnlUFE&_nc_gid=18eb1cfcc845414d98e1e6c7997cdc03&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB9LQw62NqncXMvDCaz-8-FriZqrhiH_eazRcNM6ZGdMA&oe=6716D045&_nc_sid=10d13b","marisvv_",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","que tierna","2024-06-08T07:40:56.000Z","17858859765063958","0","https://instagram.flad2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/11356572_617121905096184_1250222484_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.flad2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=2RG1kMQQDsQQ7kNvgEJeEZK&_nc_gid=18eb1cfcc845414d98e1e6c7997cdc03&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDxDkNVVo8Wr_XCZFhULpcfsNegjYRhG8P7-GxB2Dah3g&oe=6716E54C&_nc_sid=10d13b","mishcam",,,,,,,,"0","@booksaremagicbk","2023-11-30T20:22:39.000Z","18000350419861120","0","https://instagram.flad2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/368578737_313488624420564_3146965370468174638_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.flad2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=tHCvpgyxuxkQ7kNvgH03mWD&_nc_gid=18eb1cfcc845414d98e1e6c7997cdc03&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDuhugEQE_UJNJGEyuFKeJJWDB8a7toZhmI11O9z9DWiQ&oe=6716BACE&_nc_sid=10d13b","you_go_ni_coco",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","@lindwell28","2023-08-05T14:51:14.000Z","17895267431760866","0","https://instagram.flad2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/67544656_751283081958119_3068575780180066304_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.flad2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=13amS4eold8Q7kNvgHMcn1L&_nc_gid=18eb1cfcc845414d98e1e6c7997cdc03&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDSwEYtFKZHH7XsM0CesP8FvFNineQAZP6j_HZUkhAILg&oe=6716EC96&_nc_sid=10d13b","laurenmkurtz","0","This is my new favorite.","2023-06-13T03:42:48.000Z","17974933709467757","0","https://instagram.flad2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/11324285_449705665209479_1189898344_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.flad2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=bIj7HvmYClgQ7kNvgGB-y-N&_nc_gid=18eb1cfcc845414d98e1e6c7997cdc03&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAiZXXZEnGQmW9H7b9DzJQ-vMYMtdlhKpqXb4D60JeNTQ&oe=6716C8FC&_nc_sid=10d13b","girlciaran",,,,,,,,"0","@mightbechrissi 💖✨","2023-06-10T03:15:48.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"164780",,,,,,,,,,"Humans of New York","242598499","humansofny",,"CsmEMcKuZC-","2023-05-23T17:54:36.000Z","Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CsmEMcKuZC-/",,,,

But I don’t do many extracurriculars. So I’ve been focusing on my college essay. Our English teacher gave us this exercise to come up with ideas. We had to list all the letters from A to Z, and write words for each letter that relate to you. But I’d already thought about this a lot, so I just skipped straight to Z and wrote zombie apocalypse. First of all— I used to be scared of zombies. But now I’d love to be in a zombie apocalypse. So that demonstrates how feelings are, like, not permanent. Plus a zombie apocalypse would really highlight my strong points. It’s like a live-or-die type situation. You have to survive with a small group of people. In class I sometimes think about which group of people I’d choose to be with. I’d be the perfect one to assign roles because I like judging people. Someone will need to be the explorer. Another person needs to be the government kind of person. Then you’ve got to think really hard about the weapon assignments. Luckily I think about it all the time. Personally I’ll take the pistol because it’s really light weight and would allow me to keep moving. This is my friend Jiahao; I’d give him the axe. He likes to face things head on.

"Photo by Humans of New York on May 16, 2023.","“I used to say: ‘I like to watch TikTok, or YouTube.’ But I don’t really like to describe myself that way anymore. Because if you think about it, that’s not really something you do. It’s just something that pulls you in. It made me feel connected. Like, I know this person. But I really didn’t know them at all. And I’d sit at home getting sucked into this endless void of whatever I was watching. Windows closed, AC on. My dad would say: ‘Go outside and do something, it builds character.’ Most of the time he’d only say it because he wanted me to take out the trash, or go on an errand with him. So for a long time I didn’t think it meant anything. But it really does, if you think about it. Because every time you do something, it adds to who you are. You learn from life. Recently I joined a group called The Veggie Nuggets. There’s seven of us: me, my friends, a couple neighbors. We made a mural. We made a garden over by 69th and the bridge. We lobbied a little bit at the capital for climate change, because it’s kinda a disaster. I had to develop a certain mindset when I did those things. I had to affirm to something. I had to be motivated. And that’s a real thing-- motivation. It’s a trait. And now it’s part of my character.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3798","720","1080","https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/346923501_586931633247924_3552939438983313387_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=vFTy586mousQ7kNvgEMUxeN&_nc_gid=857800721909456891b1a485cd4a3db9&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCHw9LQYdBSDAZLlnq-3-CAR86kRC3lp87DGaVzBi040Q&oe=6716C475&_nc_sid=10d13b","Wow.

"Photo by Humans of New York on May 20, 2023. Aucune description de photo disponible..","“My grandmother had this big, antique mirror that she let me keep in my room. I’d stand in front of it for hours, pretending to be my favorite artists: Dionne Warwick, Barbra Streisand. I’d listen to their records over and over and mimic them. I wasn’t thinking if my voice was good or bad. I was just enjoying myself. That was my escape. It was dark in that house. There were times I’d be sitting in a sunny spot, and a giant shadow would crawl across the floor. I’d watch it closely. I didn’t understand the meaning exactly back then. But somehow I knew: whenever there’s darkness, there’s light too. Behind the house there was a garden. It was a lush garden; my grandmother was a beautiful green thumb. I’d look at all the flowers. I’d study the shape of their leaves. I’d spend hours watching bugs. The house backed up to the Van Wyck Expressway. So I’d climb up in a tree, and watch all the people go by. I was just going through so much, you know. Horrible things were being done to me. Horrible, terrible things. So I’d use whatever I could. I’d pay attention to anything that made me happy. That’s one thing I can do: pay attention. It comes from something within me. We all have it. But you know, I tap into it. I still do. I just took a picture of a flower this morning. I’m so grateful. I’m telling you, I’m so grateful that I came out of the darkness. Maybe my journey wasn't to make money or to be successful or anything. It was just to recover. I have children now. I have grandchildren. I love to bake. I’m an educated woman. I read, I write. I went to college in my fifties and graduated with a 5.0. My kids are proud of me. And I’m a great singer, too. In college the students would all beg me to sing. They’d say: ‘Torria, Torria. Sing to us, please.’ Just one song.

"Photo by Humans of New York on May 21, 2023.","“Like, porn star level sex. Ever since I was a teenager. I worked as an exotic dancer for a long time. I used to have long, red hair. I’ve been on the cover of romance novels. And I’ve also been gifted with great hands. I once wrote a book called The Extension of The Female Orgasm; I lost it in an old computer. But needless to say, I can make things happen with the human body. I’m kinda lucky downstairs, and I’ve done the work. There’s pumps and stuff that can make your ding-ding thicker and longer. But mainly I’ve been gifted with the willingness to listen. When women give you guidance, and you’re willing to listen, there’s no limit to what you can do.  I once provided thousands of orgasms over a five-year period, without ejaculating a single time. It’s called Mantak Chia’s Microcosmic Orbital Energy Raising. It’s a Daoist lovemaking technique where you don’t release your seed. You pull all your vital energies back into you, and spiral your electric body, to create a really powerful connection. Too powerful, honestly. It needs to be disclosed. Because most people don’t even realize you can take sex way deeper into an abyss of orgasmic pleasure. It’s intergalactic if you do it properly. But there’s a dark side. One time I went to somebody’s house that I hadn’t seen for two years. We were just having dinner. But then I go to the bathroom, and I open the vanity mirror—which I know I shouldn’t do—but I did, and there’s an altar to me. With all these pictures and different candles. I had to learn that I was hurting people emotionally, spiritually, and even physically. Because they’re probably never going to reach that level with someone else. Imagine having the perfect steak at your favorite restaurant, then eating nothing but dirty sock soup for the rest of your life. I never wanted to hurt people. I love people. I’m trying to be a better person. And part of being a better person is to put the other person’s feelings first. So now I tell people right from the start—the complete honest truth. You’re an amazing person. And enchantingly beautiful. But I’d rather just be friends, instead of having amazing sex that is probably going to make you hate me.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"7402","720","1080","https://instagram.fyxd4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/347724473_926695035209328_4639152246706176076_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fyxd4-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=hTBPdWelXZYQ7kNvgEM-732&_nc_gid=122be318bb484561b71199465c4fe111&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA6yVMJ1A8sG64GUlFLVJRZWJBn-RQqJqmAGh5ESH2cmA&oe=6716E3F9&_nc_sid=10d13b","…","3107915200430670807",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18008390528551346","0","https://instagram.fyxd4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/463404791_1091905248954178_1383230893424055636_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fyxd4-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=tLOT9VGRvNsQ7kNvgEdJeC2&_nc_gid=122be318bb484561b71199465c4fe111&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDiJZGtEm-TkC4cuCNCw1xemJmV8juZ8_d8M-LHx2tfaQ&oe=6716DAC5&_nc_sid=10d13b","wind__falls",,,,,,,,"0","…","2024-07-25T21:45:32.000Z","18011839883280517","2","https://instagram.fyxd4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/69991421_1100427560157498_8761350413275365376_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fyxd4-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=BLJPdXYSpAcQ7kNvgEMS997&_nc_gid=122be318bb484561b71199465c4fe111&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAEizCacWIh7e5_KLbreZsUiXnD-FaHKMnViU9q7-zD0w&oe=6716D703&_nc_sid=10d13b","fuckusatan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","lmfao i love this guy","2024-07-22T19:38:50.000Z","17990817698635579","10","https://instagram.fyxd4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/462116621_1460230131349570_3365132357071652026_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fyxd4-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=HZJG_00xO_YQ7kNvgG4cpGj&_nc_gid=122be318bb484561b71199465c4fe111&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYARl07Pgk3PiynJdEVxwEdEWfQR25mxmaPr7120jMOlJg&oe=6716DE63&_nc_sid=10d13b","evalyn_picacc",,,,,,,,"0","My teacher is making me do this for an assignment and she said that we have to read these as monologues.

"Photo by Humans of New York on May 14, 2023.","“My grandmother got us out of foster care, piece by piece. At one point there were like fifteen kids in her home: all my siblings, all my cousins. She worked all the time, sewing linings into hats for Jewish men. There was a room in the basement with four sewing machines, and everyone had to do their part. It was tough love. But she kept us together. My mother never came to visit, not even once. Not even on weekends. And I was a curious kid, so that killed me: never knowing why. But every morning I got to wake up with my siblings and my cousins, and I was thankful for that. That was beautiful. And our grandmother gave us that. One morning when I was twelve she sat me down, and said: ‘Your mother wants you back, but you’re welcome to stay.’ She gave me that choice. And I decided to move in with my mother. By that time she’d gotten clean. And she showed me love. Way more love. Way more. Not in the way of: I’m going to give you a hug, or a kiss. But listening. Like, I’m listening to you. My grandmother was stretched too thin for one-on-one. So I’d never felt heard as a child. But my mother would take me on these long walks. She’d let me talk and talk. She’d be my ear. She taught me that I have a personality. I never knew I had a personality. It was always just wake up and do what everyone else does. My mother showed me how to be happy. She was so joyful. She wore the brightest clothes. She was like a rainbow in a person, and she became my best friend. She died of a heart attack when I was fifteen; she died in my arms. And part of me is always going to feel broken because of that. That’s the part I don’t show my kids, you know. The part that still feels alone. But we had three years together. And during that time she answered all my questions; that’s what I’m most thankful for. She was an open book. She told me her trauma, her story. How she met my father. How she was introduced to a lifestyle that she just didn’t know about. How she got so addicted, and how she never wanted me to see her like that. Not even once. Now I’ll never have to wonder. She gave me the gift of knowing. Knowing why she did what she did.

You put salt and pepper, and some mayonnaise. That’s all I ate. Only problem is I live in the Bronx around a lot of Spanish people, and they always got nicknames and shit. So now my name is Tomato. I work at the stadium. But I don’t get to be at the games; I work overnights cleaning up. It’s like, fuck that. But I don’t work harder, I work smarter—I get lit. Today’s my day off so I’m just riding. I had to pull over real quick to switch to a different song. I need a song to go with the vibe. I got my suit on. I’m hyped, happy, sun is out. Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’. That’s what I need. That’s my song right there. Wooooo! It makes me want to rush. It makes me want to do all types of exciting things.

"Photo by Humans of New York on May 08, 2023.","“He’s a dangerous man. In December he came to visit. At the airport he opens the door of the Uber, and it hits another car. The driver starts screaming: ‘You broke my car!’ I pull the guy aside, and I tell him: ‘Please, not this man. Not this man.’ This man doesn’t care about nothing in this world. All that matters is his family. If my mother is happy, his kids are happy— fuck the rest of the world. When I was young he opened a restaurant in Genoa. He bought it for cheap; it used to be a Chinese restaurant. There was a giant dragon on the wall. He couldn’t afford to renovate. So he just left the mural on the wall, and named his restaurant The Dragon. After one year the restaurant failed, so he went to work on a cruise line. Every birthday, every Christmas, he was away from us. But blood is blood. The loyalty was always there. I took from him a lot of things. I never cry in my life. I solve every problem, every stuff, every bullshit. One year we have a soccer tournament in our town, for Italy’s accounting companies. My friend works at one of the biggest, and he tells me: we need a goalkeeper. So they give me paperwork for this fake internship. I show up covered in tattoos. We win every game. And after the tournament they give me a job for real. You have to take seven exams to get this job. Me? I do nothing. But the bosses know I have strong character, so they hire me. Now I am best in my company. Now I’m in America. I’d never left Italy in my life, not even on holiday. But I’m here. And I make a lot of money. A lot. The dragon is a promise. When I go back home, I’m going to buy back the restaurant. It won’t make money; but I don’t care. I only care that its ours.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1219","719","1080","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/345575042_3131536203808454_4471790301979674377_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=kABE0cWZMCYQ7kNvgF896v0&_nc_gid=35e6d285d2b343f3849051db5a559103&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBuyCjnLnJt9VZFx-zZCGPAbM6UevPpobyx_tkYk9M-rg&oe=6716EED0&_nc_sid=10d13b","❤️❤️","3098287497536331281",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17980911857445328","0","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/101384418_3544716902209093_2996122014063788032_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=E4epg0ryliYQ7kNvgFtQf3d&_nc_gid=35e6d285d2b343f3849051db5a559103&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAgU4GST-FAW2OhHShE3ugZoKfLbzdNWaEh5072smvzgA&oe=6716DE47&_nc_sid=10d13b","tee_santana",,,,,,,,"0","❤️❤️","2023-10-01T04:09:39.000Z","18382465078047456","0","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/342743931_171653972495290_7640473053059903546_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=Ises8vW2vA8Q7kNvgGji31b&_nc_gid=35e6d285d2b343f3849051db5a559103&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYABt2BMKUfYq_xZHITbDPeaiLtaoawbSlzsR-Gmw8R_AA&oe=6716D77D&_nc_sid=10d13b","osinga042",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Only healing would help him 😌","2023-08-22T15:51:27.000Z","18337880230072685","0","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/425948524_1092214302205451_9138031147169531322_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=hdJBHdrRYFwQ7kNvgGqhL7D&_nc_gid=35e6d285d2b343f3849051db5a559103&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYApDYIzem-_LNN8kH0510jdVwk4w1R2bZzayeYNvoijhw&oe=6716C93C&_nc_sid=10d13b","gigitravels4life",,,,,,,,"0","I’m multilingual so I’m pretty confused as to why people can’t follow the narrative.

But if I died today, my testament would be my community. It’s this huge queer community. Every color of the fucking rainbow. Every gender, every race, every orientation. Right now we’re having a memorial for our friend Tommy. Biggest queen ever, beautiful. Most everyone here has had to walk through life with difficulties. The way they present themselves hasn’t always been seen, or respected, or honored. But they’re still unapologetically existing. And they’re giving a lot of love. They might not have been shown a lot of love, but they’re giving a lot of love. No gender bias, no race bias, no financial bias. All they see is flesh, blood, and a fucking soul.

I was an honor student. He was smoking weed, running around, getting in trouble. My parents moved our family away from the inner city for a reason—and it was to get away from all that. But I knew his family. I knew where he’d come from. And also: sometimes I can see things. I’d pay attention. I’d watch him with his friends. And I could tell: this is not him. I knew he didn’t see himself in that space forever. And that’s been the most beautiful thing, of like, everything. Watching that transition. Seeing it all from the beginning: him figuring out that he was worthy of more. It took a while. There were times he messed up, and I won’t make excuses for that. There were lulls. We’d date other people for a while, but every time he’d come back hard. And not just like: ‘I’m sorry, babe. Please take me back.’ He’d put in more effort. He’d grow. And now he’s gotten to a place where he has a much better understanding of his existence. He’s a vegan. He meditates every day. And he’s very serious about it; he’s descriptive about the reasons he changed his life. A lot’s been thrown at him recently. Both of us work at underprivileged schools, which can be exhausting. But I’ve seen him stay up for twenty-four hours, go to work, then come home and still be present. He’s a nurturing father. He’s a protector. It wasn’t always in him. But it’s in him now. And not to toot my own horn, but I saw it. What I saw was this. Exactly this.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1826","720","1080","https://instagram.fplu3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/345862941_254247750620313_5534108642312420962_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fplu3-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=T8xEQ1dK8qgQ7kNvgE05Dd2&_nc_gid=760b7412b0f9440a8aea23f362f95ffd&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCYmFLMJAka9wXcLhPA4J-qvtq_Hrla51HnKCGf3cANkA&oe=6716E01B&_nc_sid=10d13b","This is lovely.","3100513029624369559",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18010505542887107","0","https://instagram.fplu3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/342743931_171653972495290_7640473053059903546_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fplu3-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=Ises8vW2vA8Q7kNvgH0nq0U&_nc_gid=760b7412b0f9440a8aea23f362f95ffd&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBV9D2EhXyhDCkuziCGEtuaUJrNrQG4vsd-V7S_Q3ccfg&oe=6716D77D&_nc_sid=10d13b","osinga042",,,,,,,,"0","This is lovely.","2023-08-22T15:50:04.000Z","17963416115379227","0","https://instagram.fplu3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/356953662_629154782489962_5325131346721902901_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fplu3-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=2SueEYbn1psQ7kNvgFkh1x1&_nc_gid=760b7412b0f9440a8aea23f362f95ffd&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAyF0cLGt-L6fomSl0jUISKlyhdFGBZQiN3G7-Hlyplrw&oe=6716BCD5&_nc_sid=10d13b","joshhphy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","This is so beautiful ❤️❤️","2023-07-01T13:31:24.000Z","18002357659846705","1","https://instagram.fplu3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/344818961_773564037536196_3877191659514918067_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fplu3-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=PhX2-FI4u1AQ7kNvgE26o1C&_nc_gid=760b7412b0f9440a8aea23f362f95ffd&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBleUFGAAxMf1k3pZCuAiPxiEiCyMncEk6lN9cqsfhicA&oe=6716C49A&_nc_sid=10d13b","gracias_amor_1",,,,,,,,"0","Walk away when your expectations are not met was the highlight of this post.

It was moment-to-moment, paycheck-to-paycheck. At one point we were living in a one bedroom apartment with eight kids. It was chaos. There was always something happening: fighting over the remote control, or whose clothes, or whose shoes. But we also had each other for happiness. All of us were going through the same thing. The whole family shared a single camera-- a point and shoot. Everybody got a turn. And it got used a lot. Today if you go into my home, or my dad’s home, you’re going to find a bunch of albums. Whenever we get together, we'll take them out. It's mainly just photos of the day-to-day stuff: birthdays, holidays. Maybe a picture of us all sitting at a table, eating a meal. But if you think about it real quick: that's what life really is. Some of my happiest moments are just eating with my family. Food, laughter, and a lot of people. That's love to me. Nobody’s thinking about what happened before we sat down. Nobody’s worried about what’s going to happen when we leave. We just trying to get this food.”","Photo by Humans of New York on May 18, 2023.

"Photo by Humans of New York on April 04, 2023.","“Here’s something: if my wife and children are upset, or in trouble, I have a physical ache. It’s a physical thing. That’s real. But other than that—I don’t feel much. Don’t get me wrong. It’s nice when my kids give me a hug and all that jazz. I even participate-- in the same way an actor would participate. But I’m not overwhelmed from within or anything. My wife is a different story. It’s night and day. The kissing, the hugging, birthdays, Christmas, all those tropes. But when I watch them it’s like I’m looking at a painting. Where there’s love and happiness and joy and anger, but I’m just an observer. I can’t remember it ever being another way. I had a very uptight English upbringing. My mother would never dream of saying: ‘I love you,’ or anything like that. Annoyed the hell out of my brother. He thought she didn’t like him. I told him: ‘You’re over thinking that one, mate.’ She did what needed to be done. Who cares if it was connected to a feeling? But I get it. Feelings are about connection and all that. They don’t cost money. Not to be all John Lennon about it-- but love is a powerful thing. I can appreciate that. As a concept.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1301","720","1080","https://scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/339498231_6813332728717425_2723348723094471538_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=cZTlNTydL-MQ7kNvgH7k-XB&_nc_gid=2f7bae899cfe4c64b7570e5cec1c9528&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCiOI1r73wm07FvCauZDyc2cdLHulbwwe3tK1WG-A8vDg&oe=6716D91D&_nc_sid=10d13b","HG Tudor @knowingthenarcissist_the_ultra ?","3073712411375052907",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17844034182106225","0","https://scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/241808746_1266989067073221_2453627485433215345_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=auc9YVZ11HIQ7kNvgHR90qZ&_nc_gid=2f7bae899cfe4c64b7570e5cec1c9528&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDyjDCgZuTTdyIGoZSh9oqk5LDDUa5d690WTnCf_n8VDA&oe=6716BC35&_nc_sid=10d13b","quinnobiintuitivecoaching",,,,,,,,"0","HG Tudor @knowingthenarcissist_the_ultra ?","2023-11-18T18:06:33.000Z","17875793693926597","0","https://scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/436333524_497578745928173_6531443646321001944_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=s-rEU1UErG0Q7kNvgGkU0hm&_nc_gid=2f7bae899cfe4c64b7570e5cec1c9528&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCkTSRChK-rBOlxN3FjHn-UvUk-BAMAqO5ZiJL_EYwr3A&oe=6716DD6D&_nc_sid=10d13b","passion_aflame",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","I want to hug this man... he's working so hard","2023-07-19T00:48:01.000Z","18011398015604610","0","https://scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/338572959_140800162270448_9027897077469742659_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=lhcpdcVzhzYQ7kNvgEHpVJN&_nc_gid=2f7bae899cfe4c64b7570e5cec1c9528&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAGA5XlnlrB4evguheTG3w9oeSBF066a2m0KgO2_yNObg&oe=6716C568&_nc_sid=10d13b","madmamanyc",,,,,,,,"0","To be on that level of awareness, he’s probably in therapy.

Clarification from Marc: I wanted to elaborate on my first statement. For me, deciding to create our child was a leap of faith, inspired by love.  I wasn't in touch with any personal desire to procreate, at least not at that moment in my life.  Still, I knew that if it happened, I would love my child more than myself from the moment she was conceived.

"Photo by Humans of New York on April 17, 2023.","“He’s going to be—he is—the man who will dance around the living room with her and make silly faces and tell her silly stories and tell her that he loves her all the time and take her on great adventures and read her amazing stories and make cool shit with her and go on long walks with her and put the world right for her. Just the way they look at each other. She can’t see shit. But he sees a lot. It’s different than he looks at me. It’s so pure. He notices every change in her face. Every noise that comes out of her.  Just having someone doting on you like that. I just think how lucky she’s going to be. And being able to see that energy between a father and daughter. Even if I didn’t get to experience that myself—just to be around it now, it does a lot of healing for me. I feel like so much is slowly repairing in my cellular being. I lost my dad when I was young. Things were heavy dark. I’ve always associated love with pain and tragedy and loss and grief—but knowing that I can let go of that, and experience love in a light and beautiful way. It’s exciting. Like, love is fun. Love is pretty fucking fun.”","Photo by Humans of New York on April 17, 2023.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/341590697_247724794289479_5172928812639624400_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=sbJsMw6pf84Q7kNvgGaQlgp&_nc_gid=a783c7c07bb040a495c53fe65200e46d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCYqAu8tz5g8l529S9BS6ybNUvedR_U3uTal_-056lXJg&oe=6716EA9A&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3082948632756526140",,,"CrI1XKEOpw8",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CrI1XKEOpw8/","Photo by Humans of New York on April 17, 2023.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/341570090_616634847175493_7111963683769815705_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=LrBjHIkCTwcQ7kNvgGL70Bk&_nc_gid=a783c7c07bb040a495c53fe65200e46d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYACVHGyPJnfXaZx2_hvhIeyUrYQdg8-uCvTKo-AieMC0A&oe=6716EC07&_nc_sid=10d13b","","3082948632840480081",,,"CrI1XKJO6VR",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CrI1XKJO6VR/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1617","720","1080","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/341590697_247724794289479_5172928812639624400_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=sbJsMw6pf84Q7kNvgGaQlgp&_nc_gid=a783c7c07bb040a495c53fe65200e46d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCYqAu8tz5g8l529S9BS6ybNUvedR_U3uTal_-056lXJg&oe=6716EA9A&_nc_sid=10d13b","I’m late to the party here, but goooosh lots of happy tears for you three and all of us to be blessed by the halo of your love @missllamamanyc @nico.r.eyes (shoutout @katsu_the_don) 😭🥰❤️❤️❤️ side note: can we talk about your gentle fuchsia nail color too?!","3082948637915583198","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/341590697_247724794289479_5172928812639624400_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=sbJsMw6pf84Q7kNvgGaQlgp&_nc_gid=a783c7c07bb040a495c53fe65200e46d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCYqAu8tz5g8l529S9BS6ybNUvedR_U3uTal_-056lXJg&oe=6716EA9A&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/341570090_616634847175493_7111963683769815705_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=LrBjHIkCTwcQ7kNvgGL70Bk&_nc_gid=a783c7c07bb040a495c53fe65200e46d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYACVHGyPJnfXaZx2_hvhIeyUrYQdg8-uCvTKo-AieMC0A&oe=6716EC07&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18391614223023005","0","https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/14334669_554781984711995_5379649587113885696_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=_6k4q_yyQ-kQ7kNvgHXlWN5&_nc_gid=a783c7c07bb040a495c53fe65200e46d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCxIEby2Y42zP7JQCNobMhCOxk1LvhzQK_SZKCLf4VgKw&oe=6716D9CD&_nc_sid=10d13b","therubezzz",,,,,,,,"0","I’m late to the party here, but goooosh lots of happy tears for you three and all of us to be blessed by the halo of your love @missllamamanyc @nico.r.eyes (shoutout @katsu_the_don) 😭🥰❤️❤️❤️ side note: can we talk about your gentle fuchsia nail color too?!","2023-10-27T04:49:12.000Z","17895750440823983","0","https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/11371293_606511096158431_1873812419_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=SDAMavlx13sQ7kNvgEbwET1&_nc_gid=a783c7c07bb040a495c53fe65200e46d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD6NCSSO2Coz21jAe38ZCri2Xc7pTyka7IFFIyPkO8gqQ&oe=6716E7A4&_nc_sid=10d13b","queenmajestyhotsauce",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","❤️❤️❤️","2023-06-28T11:06:28.000Z","18021752452562818","0","https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/269701340_669203744096393_5147247059430511958_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=fqwAzOgVVk0Q7kNvgHS0SQC&_nc_gid=a783c7c07bb040a495c53fe65200e46d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCCB_GLzcjCK_X_yXSFFyWZGoUHy9UsiGeddmhiOF3GJQ&oe=6716CF91&_nc_sid=10d13b","joyful.girl.recovery",,,,,,,,"0","They are ❤️❤️❤️beautiful","2023-06-10T05:27:59.000Z","17864137610945700","0","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/11887246_878506705561048_169110473_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=HdXMn_ZU0RoQ7kNvgGHu4q3&_nc_gid=a783c7c07bb040a495c53fe65200e46d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYANgDvFt99ZGBZ1SRQXApQ0f9yo-f0r39ub-b9770zT0g&oe=6716C217&_nc_sid=10d13b","miymiyy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","The last 3 lines.

Always made sure there was food on the table, always washed our clothes, always took care of me when I was sick.  But she was fierce when we were kids. She’d get angry with me, zero to a hundred, in a second. I could never understand why. I know she had a tough upbringing: Guatemala, small town, no father. And I’ve had my own share of demons. It’s been a twenty-year struggle with alcohol. I would come over here completely blacked out, blasting music, acting like a dirtbag. There are neighbors in this building who still won’t talk to me. I also said some hurtful things to my dad. He wanted nothing to do with me in his final years. But I’m seven months sober now, so God willing we’re done with all that. Little by little I’m trying to be the man of the household. I’m suppressing old feelings and just trying to help her be comfortable. I’m not a good cook. But I kill it for breakfast. So on Saturdays I make breakfast: eggs, beans, bread, soup. She’s a very good soup eater. I try to get everyone seated at the table, and involve my daughters in the conversation. Afterwards I line up some good entertainment. She likes the television. When it’s warm I’ll take her to the park. A few months ago I brought her to a soccer game at the Red Bull Arena. It was Colombia vs Guatemala—too perfect. My father was Colombian, so we’re all half-and-half. I maxed out my credit card and bought the whole family tickets. It was unbelievable. A year ago I wouldn’t have even been able to enjoy it. I’d have been drinking beers nonstop. I’d probably have blacked out by halftime. But I was completely sober, watching the field, watching my family enjoy the game. My mom was loving it. She was cheering like crazy. Wearing her Guatemalan jersey.  Guatemalan flags everywhere, and lots of quetzals—the national bird. She was in heaven. I honestly think it was one of the best days of her life.

"Photo by Humans of New York on April 19, 2023.","“My wife has my back. More than the girlfriend. If I ever got in trouble, my wife would be there-- so I love her too. But it’s two different worlds. My wife and I fuck, but when my girlfriend is in front of me—it’s like: I need that now. We found each other at that perfect moment in time. Extensive track records: multiple partners, multiple situations. Then we came together to reach the zenith. I know my role. I can bring her to a certain point. And a big part of my satisfaction is getting her to that place. Every time is different, or we’ll go through phases: do one thing for a month, put it down, pick something else up. It’s never gotten old. For the longest time I didn’t know her husband’s name, or where he lived. But things got too blurred. A couple years back we got caught. It was my fault. I was drunk; wife got the phone. In therapy my wife was like: why don’t you do that stuff with me? It’s like, look, nobody checks every box. It’s impossible, impossible. If your wife checks five, and you got six other boxes—you’re going to check those boxes somewhere else. This whole monogamy thing is just a story. It’s made up. It doesn’t work. Look at nature--- the males fuck different females, the females fuck different males. She was like: ‘But you took a vow.’ And I do feel bad. I’m sorry to disappoint her. But it’s like, you knew this. You can’t be so naïve that you think all the sudden the leopard is going to change his spots. When we first got together—I was cheating on the girl I was with.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"14253","719","1080","https://scontent-mia3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/341969203_1305986343465075_194132998336238739_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=z2PaKwOO54QQ7kNvgHtQGZ5&_nc_gid=db10b5a07c614087a9d1c47c52cf7ffa&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAmef9jQIh63q6yhOWW39QrJqkYxPReAwsZ--AdpjQn-Q&oe=6716D6BB&_nc_sid=10d13b","What a pos","3084454093972529822",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17987299175589181","0","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/431382768_415088467685831_8474804451718051773_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=Dlx9mfL2kZ0Q7kNvgGmONca&_nc_gid=db10b5a07c614087a9d1c47c52cf7ffa&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBguv5xEj1ci1KSpjeBF6rlmn7Zo7OomYX1bF1qpu34Qw&oe=6716C101&_nc_sid=10d13b","glenyeezy",,,,,,,,"0","What a pos","2023-11-30T04:59:50.000Z","17879661110969038","0","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/456419028_819148110207438_3017424864227688455_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=wL4PDTpOqXoQ7kNvgHcKClI&_nc_gid=db10b5a07c614087a9d1c47c52cf7ffa&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBYBN5GiEWTVDsdAYJM1Bzk_CvslCidpgJsKQv-SjM7cg&oe=6716DDEC&_nc_sid=10d13b","moonjam5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Huh yeah keep drinking that cope juice smh 😑😒","2023-11-01T18:28:35.000Z","17987285147202822","0","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/425750718_2566904136824430_3008343565970603523_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=vatmlxAvx5kQ7kNvgHNyB3a&_nc_gid=db10b5a07c614087a9d1c47c52cf7ffa&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCeFKcMqPq3ryMpft1OR35w8bjOZN0PGqc8XG98LRWC8g&oe=6716EF3E&_nc_sid=10d13b","africanprizee",,,,,,,,"0","Ewwww","2023-10-14T15:14:01.000Z","18372973954067099","2","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/101384418_3544716902209093_2996122014063788032_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=E4epg0ryliYQ7kNvgF86Y1S&_nc_gid=db10b5a07c614087a9d1c47c52cf7ffa&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCp7BmMzmxAZ_ojdvz745eGaM0Mr53J2tDmPyNeU5a5ug&oe=6716DE47&_nc_sid=10d13b","tee_santana",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Too many people on here projecting their hurt in comments.

"Photo by Humans of New York on January 26, 2023. Nenhuma descrição de foto disponível..","“There was a bad break up, sort of. It was eight months ago. I’m past it now. But I had to experience that for the first time. I don’t think I handled it as well as I could. At the time I couldn’t grasp that maybe it wasn’t anybody’s fault. Maybe I just wanted to be with the person for longer than they wanted to be with me. But accepting things that you don’t want to happen is really, really hard. It’s like: ‘Why do they get to walk around, and keep living their life, while I’m miserable all the time?’ It didn’t seem fair. So I might have reacted in a way that was disproportionate, to make the person feel more guilty than they needed to. Sometimes that’s your only recourse when someone hurts you: feeling aggrieved, and making it known. Not that it keeps you from suffering. But there is a sense of power in it. It allows you to redistribute the pain that you’re feeling. You can make their life a hassle for a bit, hurt their feelings, tell everyone they’re a big asshole. When the truth is: maybe they were just living their life, trying their best, and you got hurt. There’s not always a villain.

Stomping around in these big, chunky boots. He’d have a tag with his name on it: Herbie— written big like. He was always so noticeable. That’s the main thing I remember: the other parents seemed smaller. Maybe not smaller, but sleeker: tight button-tops, khakis. I was one of two Hispanic kids in my grade. I’d only gotten in through a program that sends black and brown kids to private school. But I never felt discriminated against. We all loved the same video games and YouTube videos. Within a few weeks I was going to friends’ houses for sleepovers. These houses were humongous. Everyone had their own rooms. Then I’d go back to our house, in the Hispanic neighborhood. And it was just a square with a triangle roof. And we had like ten people living there. It was different. Behind closed doors, I knew we were different. And that juxtaposition was a little too much to overcome in my head. I felt like if I wanted to fully step into this new role, I needed to shed all that. I’m on the other side of it now. I graduated from a private university. I’m working at a tech start-up. I feel like this was it. When my parents came over, this was their intention. I’ve fully assimilated. But now that I’m here, I kinda miss what I’ve left behind. I’ve lost it. It’s not that I chose another culture. My life just got filled with other stuff, and I let it go by the wayside. I don’t even really speak Spanish anymore. Maybe in very small bursts, or whatever. But I miss the curse words, the slang. I miss it being commonplace. Mainly I just miss being around people like me: feature wise, and stuff like that. At least now that I’m in New York, I can take the train home every other weekend. It’s like a celebration, every time I come back. We don’t all live together anymore; but the whole family’s nearby. Everyone comes over. My dad grills out: steak, tortillas, vegetables. Eating home cooked food, it’s like I’m a kid again. It’s healing in a way. It feels right. Knowing I’m in a good spot. I’ve gotten to where I want to be, but I’m back with the people that I’ve always been with.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1410","720","1080","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/328299974_213248188041289_8824833734411775287_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=WAa_jTTCrJ4Q7kNvgHgZA1v&_nc_gid=43aec204221a45c09f96f38606907ae8&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB57yeHA3AKhqsG81wk09H3F9ByjxHDeQMQs5WkJ6bUhw&oe=6716CCAC&_nc_sid=10d13b","@charlottelzry","3028765336543993064",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18289233385204370","1","https://scontent-ams2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/44884218_345707102882519_2446069589734326272_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-ams2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=CWrd8f4xNJwQ7kNvgHqYuG0&_nc_gid=a785511f42bd42c7a180bfabe2f8c9d4&edm=AAAAAAABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=YW5vbnltb3VzX3Byb2ZpbGVfcGlj.3-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYBdQkHRlbbMOvX3YMU3iuzdNM-7saqC1Np7LzdB130PDw&oe=6716D24F&_nc_sid=328259","kk.n____",,,,,,,,"0","@charlottelzry","2024-07-28T17:35:00.000Z","17962871837640934","0","https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/269770277_597955298139822_5033566796417590624_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=rHoz1oNd3EcQ7kNvgHoGQhE&_nc_gid=43aec204221a45c09f96f38606907ae8&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBxKw6g-PW_Icmbrrg71jYyYQM0jumZVisINtESxGJigA&oe=6716D08A&_nc_sid=10d13b","dillydallier100",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","@ avacaricjurkota I cannot reply as #insagramracist censorship is deeming my response as racist 🤦‍♀️","2023-10-03T10:01:07.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"155071",,,,,,,,,,"Humans of New York","242598499","humansofny",,"CoIVgbIuJzo","2023-02-01T18:43:05.000Z","Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CoIVgbIuJzo/",,,,
"Photo by Humans of New York on April 18, 2023.","“We have a cabinet in our apartment called The Witch Cabinet; it’s full of knick-knacks: tarot cards, random rocks, bottle caps, buttons; there’s a whole beaver skull in there. Our walls are covered in murals. Our window sills are covered with random bunches of dried flowers that we meant to put in jars. She could describe the relationship better. She’s better with words than me. But if there’s such thing as a platonic soulmate—Emme is that. She’s the first person I send anything. My God, absolutely anything: I want to try this video game, I want to try this recipe, I want to try this restaurant—so you’re going with me. I have a favorite podcast called The Old Gods of Appalachia. Emme’s never even heard of it. But they’re having a show tonight, and she’s coming along. We’ve been roommates for seven years. It's the first time I’ve ever lived in a home where I was allowed to speak up about things that bothered me. Emme taught me how to do the ‘friend call-out.’ You know, like: ‘You’re my best friend. But what you’re doing is really fucking shitty.’ The first time it happened, it was a big ‘oh yeah’ moment for me. Like, oh yeah: there’s a way to talk about hard things without yelling at each other, or ignoring each other. She’s helped me work through a lot of stuff. And I’ve tried to help her with some things too. She’s not exactly where she wants to be right now; sometimes she blames herself. It’s like, girl-- you’re the hardest worker I know; it’s obviously the fucking job market. She also has no idea how pretty she is. It’s like, girl—are you seeing what I’m seeing? Then one time she actually said: ‘I’m not that fun.’ Not that fun? Girl, you light up a fucking room.’”","Photo by Humans of New York on April 18,

"Photo by Humans of New York on April 26, 2023.","“Maybe something happened. Maybe I’ll be driving to the softball game, and I’m sad. Cause something bad happened. I’m gonna keep that moment kinda private. If I need to talk through it, I’ll call someone. So when it’s time to step out of the car—I’m happy. I like to keep that image. This guy Jay, he’s always happy. If you talk to Jay, he’ll brighten up your day. Sometimes it drives the guys at work crazy. I work in Sanitation. Our shift starts at 5 AM. These guys are coming in from all over: they’re tired, they’re dragging. But I’m whistling. I’ve got my Dunkin Donuts coffee. I’m saying: good morning, bro. What’s up? We’re about to make some money. Good, honest day’s work. Every time you get to the end of the block, you look back. You see the whole block is nice and clean, the sidewalk’s nice and clean. So I’m smiling. The guys call me Smiley. Billy started that. He said I’m the only one who comes to work smiling. But I’m like: how can you not be happy? Maybe it’s just the way the dominos have fallen for me. I have great friends, a great career, a great family. My brother is like my best buddy. Been dating a girl for three years. She teaches dance to little kids. We go out dancing together, salsa dancing. Yo, she’s great man. It’s like, how could I ever have a bad day? Been that way since I was a kid. Nobody could put me down. In the morning I’d be like: Another day of school? Let’s do it! And listen, when I got home, if Grandma made the skirt steak. With the rice and beans, and the plantains. She’d be like: yo, Jay. Tonight I made your favorite. And bro, I would get hyped.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2171","720","1080","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/343294404_989466422043069_8286097686622498429_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=rgDBnFJtNtAQ7kNvgEIgZG_&_nc_gid=49d68a251ff8430297992cc38f3f8fde&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAzJeI7jYK0XzrTlNH2KvUNjLWbrH5BPk5YKbmOGqyKAw&oe=6716DD1D&_nc_sid=10d13b","Angels walk among us","3089621391154639395",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18051824071740407","0","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/463404791_1091905248954178_1383230893424055636_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=tLOT9VGRvNsQ7kNvgHuNElK&_nc_gid=49d68a251ff8430297992cc38f3f8fde&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAb2fUFNATsdITQMw7dlRsWAr8aILUyru5JaSDwiEkzMw&oe=6716DAC5&_nc_sid=10d13b","wind__falls",,,,,,,,"0","Angels walk among us","2024-07-25T21:36:07.000Z","17988481106574811","1","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/347417686_1614771459021851_197035083075549026_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=m2OQVZ05ofQQ7kNvgFcX8QN&_nc_gid=49d68a251ff8430297992cc38f3f8fde&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCpjHAZA5y7iorIZmNJmXWEfwurgeU-GkQFkAcZttw6XA&oe=6716D5F0&_nc_sid=10d13b","justtdibb",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","wholesome♥️","2024-01-10T18:07:26.000Z","18010029538833045","0","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/425750718_2566904136824430_3008343565970603523_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=vatmlxAvx5kQ7kNvgEWSQN2&_nc_gid=49d68a251ff8430297992cc38f3f8fde&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDkWv9D1coLixfjoZCU-TXAx3P9SV8IFcR7qCbGp8nYRA&oe=6716EF3E&_nc_sid=10d13b","africanprizee",,,,,,,,"0","This makes my heart smile so much.

"Photo by Humans of New York on January 17, 2023.","“I worked as a legal assistant for 50 years. And I’ve always been lucky to work for honest, kind, brilliant attorneys. All that paperwork might seem boring to other people. But I never even took lunch, that’s how much I loved it. I loved the law. It’s very precise. My work needed to be exactly right. And there was a lot of pride there. But something seems to have changed in the culture. So many of my coworkers would rush out the door at 5 o’clock. With important, unfinished things on their desk. In law you have to get things out quickly, but it’s like they just didn’t care. Maybe it’s a generational thing. I’m older, I’m 77. So maybe there’s something I don’t get. ‘Quiet quitting,’ and all of that, I just don’t understand it. If it’s just a paycheck to you—if you’re getting by on the minimum, and not trying to be perfect, or God forbid, if you're screwing it up on purpose-- why are you even going to work? Save your pennies and quit. Find something else you can take pride in. If you’re spending eight hours a day on something you don’t take pride in, it seems to me that somewhere, deep down inside, you’re a phony. Maybe not a phony. But you’re deluding yourself. It’s going to spill over into the rest of your life. And there’s not enough money for me. Well, $20,000 a week maybe. But otherwise there’s not enough money for me to not take pride in my work. I couldn’t do it. I know that sounds ridiculous, but I can’t. You know how people text, and there’s like spelling mistakes and grammar mistakes and everything? Not me. I’ll reread everything. I’ll go back and fix it, I’ll put in the comma. That’s who I am. You either have it or you don’t, and less people have it now. I think it was the digital revolution. When I first started working there were typewriters. If you made a mistake, you had to redo it. You had to be careful, you had to get it right-- until the computer came along. I remember my boss was so excited about the computer age. He said: ‘It’s going to be great! We’re going to have a paperless office!’ I knew better. I told him: ‘There’s going to be a lot more paper, actually.’ Because you can reprint everything. And nobody’s going to care anymore.’”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3802","720","1080","https://instagram.fagc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/325981761_1293243397919393_1873154821802158589_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fagc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=3qm0LjViWmwQ7kNvgFeh5Zx&_nc_gid=30cd484d954b4aab8297ec3ad93c770e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA-iTpePseV2si_PlxxT8LI4gaaYPbucJdHrmXbSZFJcQ&oe=6716D12A&_nc_sid=10d13b","The new generation thinks they are more valuable than their worth.","3017786670871828583",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17978596421410786","1","https://instagram.fagc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/439575307_979130587072948_6527614814705180771_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fagc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=Z7Ueb9QRheUQ7kNvgGLScSW&_nc_gid=30cd484d954b4aab8297ec3ad93c770e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDGc8uQ0_RqjM7pXcUaigb9Z53ioImlRCqeKvtLfiHSlQ&oe=6716E4D8&_nc_sid=10d13b","vhs_cleaner",,,,,,,,"0","The new generation thinks they are more valuable than their worth.","2023-11-21T05:58:44.000Z","18016189300643889","1","https://instagram.fagc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/425750718_2566904136824430_3008343565970603523_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fagc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=vatmlxAvx5kQ7kNvgGYLhD3&_nc_gid=30cd484d954b4aab8297ec3ad93c770e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCS5Wyil7OwgkDGIAin3U1vYBg2kV0Bn0CVjSRhhs7y_w&oe=6716EF3E&_nc_sid=10d13b","africanprizee",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Yeaaaa…no.

"Photo by Humans of New York on January 22, 2023.","If you are a regular reader of Humans of New York, I’d ask that you please consider joining the Patreon. Patreon is a more personal platform for me. Each month I share one piece of writing, explaining my process and thinking. But mainly it’s what allows me to focus on Humans of New York full time. For twelve years HONY has told more than ten thousand stories of ordinary people. And during this time over $20 million has been raised in direct assistance for those in need. All of this is made possible through book sales, and the steady support of Patreon subscribers. There has never been an advertisement or sponsored post. I’ve always believed that Humans of New York works best when I’m invisible. But behind-the-scenes, my own family has been growing. And while the longevity of Humans of New York has been a constant marvel to me, artists don’t typically enjoy as much of a safety net. So in addition to enabling my work, the monthly support from Patreon subscribers has been a huge part of my peace of mind. As with most artists, 99% of the reward is in being seen. So your presence is more than enough compensation. But if you’re in a good place right now, and you derive value from Humans of New York, and you’d like to support its creation, I hope you’ll consider joining the Patreon through the link in bio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"580","1080","1080","https://instagram.fpia1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/326487896_700349828152314_590310464579579878_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fpia1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=qJsqmaesz_cQ7kNvgG-fIU3&_nc_gid=a9bd24502b3644ba8c05e215780205d9&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYALYaqaS6cxzWjVowzQ3VkXA4W0yVUI4noM-08QABvuRw&oe=6716DD5F&_nc_sid=10d13b","❤️❤️❤️","3021673049925995898",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18033579574861650","0","https://instagram.fpia1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/460449988_1249098349420475_5858263144817892871_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fpia1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=iIrHW3z-ywMQ7kNvgGKr47e&_nc_gid=a9bd24502b3644ba8c05e215780205d9&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBT7GcUXt44oIRxpoY6tn-NokvyV40AXYqCTSUllxWEtg&oe=6716ED81&_nc_sid=10d13b","alana_murray2008",,,,,,,,"0","❤️❤️❤️","2024-03-14T14:00:05.000Z","17943048593654302","1","https://scontent-ams2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/44884218_345707102882519_2446069589734326272_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e0_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-ams2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=CWrd8f4xNJwQ7kNvgF4cKb8&_nc_gid=727554c01ca846ef97c1dbfad6c95512&edm=AA0lj5EBAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=YW5vbnltb3VzX3Byb2ZpbGVfcGlj.3-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYAJRqG9lk-fxqavLQu6V00mtVHkR0Mb-7nJGWRU-Fc0ag&oe=6716D24F&_nc_sid=0a490e","ecd889",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","I did sign up for Patreon a while back.

"Photo by Humans of New York on December 20, 2022.","“When I was a kid I’d hide between the bedpost and the wall and read books about King Arthur. I wanted to be a knight. I wanted to be anything other than my father. We lived under his rule; it was horror. My mother was loving, and strong in many ways. But she wouldn’t leave him. I used to watch her wipe her own blood off the walls. When I was thirteen I ran away for good. I didn’t tell her a thing; I just disappeared. And I know she was hurt by that. I slept in the park with a whole crew of punks and addicts. People in the neighborhood would give me little jobs. They trusted me, and I never stole from them. Because I had honor. I’d rob a leather coat from Macy’s in a minute, but that’s Macy’s. I’d never take a woman’s pocketbook. I’d never break into a deli. No matter how far I fell, my honor never failed me. Music never failed me. And a good book never failed me. One day it was pouring down rain, and I ducked into a cubby hole. There was a copy of The Diary of Anne Frank; just laying there. I was stoned out of my face. And I knew nothing about this little girl. But it’s pouring down rain; there was nothing else to do. So I read the whole thing. She was beautiful. All this horror, but she was surviving. And that gave me strength. By the time I was twenty-five I had my own room, with a hot plate, and a pair of reeboks. I was playing music with some cool cats. I was proud. It’s like: I’m making it. When I finally got clean, the first thing I did was knock on my mother’s door. Hadn’t seen her for twenty years, but she gave me the biggest hug. She told me that every Sunday since I’d left, she’d lit a candle and prayed for my soul. That night she cooked some chicken, which I killed. Then she gave me what was left in some Tupperware. That was smart, because I had to bring back the Tupperware. And I never stopped coming back. I’m 66 now. I’m clean, I live comfortably, I’m financially OK. And I still go to see her every Sunday. She’s 94. She’s half-blind. She can’t hear. But I’ll bring her cake, and we’ll talk. She likes to take my hand, so she can feel my rings. And while we’re talking, I can tell: she’s in heaven. I was able to give her that. I gave her peace.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2083","719","1080","https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/320926606_1181691862741700_8580719843271192006_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=Ll4VZYz3nEAQ7kNvgFut1nm&_nc_gid=beed0c4940704b6f8b4cf69871bcf60c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBr-tfN4EP03Ip6bogEJxQ0DZWHUo-ck8n5q_qsBd7Liw&oe=6716E314&_nc_sid=10d13b","@tflores24 one of so many great stories!","2997487348678679299",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18010998230240860","0","https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/314368844_410649594617928_6453261657966863283_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=ANVzxrHyYDwQ7kNvgFVtl3h&_nc_gid=beed0c4940704b6f8b4cf69871bcf60c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBKPb1g11Nh_B-QZBQJlO4jt7WUn7ZVDXnVuSxX-t1Dfg&oe=6716E8A4&_nc_sid=10d13b","oliveopolivieliv4",,,,,,,,"0","@tflores24 one of so many great stories!","2024-06-21T04:00:44.000Z","18020551313084495","0","https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/40901722_1860166590732776_7852767373344899072_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=e2zaqatZuLMQ7kNvgGKEnfY&_nc_gid=beed0c4940704b6f8b4cf69871bcf60c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCqZfMl8Ve9RVZpJ4iZYYLWy175wOvPS6LYKJNsJuuBvA&oe=6716E715&_nc_sid=10d13b","hurrikanecat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Beautiful.","2024-03-07T05:28:08.000Z","18273950062194295","2","https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/427220174_1106291293856372_6632439298650726016_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=CokLlcYgudcQ7kNvgH6kuU4&_nc_gid=beed0c4940704b6f8b4cf69871bcf60c&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCtPEsy-FPnB-lwJmHRnRtCMxi-_nRUAlfIuCofKZ9opg&oe=6716D271&_nc_sid=10d13b","btksheba",,,,,,,,"0","Sometimes God’s angels come in form of a book.

"Photo by Humans of New York on December 28, 2022.","“It felt like freedom, maybe; but I was spiraling. There was a hurricane in my head: certain addictions, and impulsive decisions that could affect me for the rest of my life. Other people would see it, and they’d say: ‘He’s so fun.’ But nobody was looking at me, really. They’d never have noticed if I was hurting myself, or if I slipped away. I got good at floating around and giving people what they want-- just enough positivity-- so I could get through the moment and leave a good impression. But I can’t do that with her. When I think a certain thing, she reacts. She wants to know more. And when I feel a certain way, she feels it too. Nobody’s cared like she cared, you know? I feel seen. I feel found. Like there’s something outside of me. Like somebody touched my face. Sometimes when I’m sleeping, she’ll do this thing. She’ll reach over and touch my face. She’ll just hold onto it. And that’s the image that keeps coming into my head, when I try to describe her. She touched my face.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"983","1080","1080","https://scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/322495928_474116178009828_7952195468288804319_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=f2MsbgMyz7AQ7kNvgENYRoW&_nc_gid=8cee68997b634daaa441f9d459debbf9&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDBxX5OEDQEk-i948uG_3DSKV4WaJhLgQL-rqexZuDfWQ&oe=6716DDD7&_nc_sid=10d13b","❤️","3003431122873450162",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17861081582978833","1","https://scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/451717491_1659933528098767_8819098091755630147_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=woA4fJ42blwQ7kNvgGA77ep&_nc_gid=8cee68997b634daaa441f9d459debbf9&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAZQ8xk6RGiMHjCyngP74xkfewv1jdcPBVChaZqKbyRUg&oe=6716EE8D&_nc_sid=10d13b","crystalhemsworthjones",,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2023-07-26T19:41:24.000Z","18371816092059565","1","https://scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/395454368_884950909890462_3138767124375413656_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=Kqnc1uNcbxQQ7kNvgG5oYW8&_nc_gid=8cee68997b634daaa441f9d459debbf9&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAFAfDN2hiWb2d9e0VeiaRTN6GyHlegdrvua-SaWPQroQ&oe=6716D0A8&_nc_sid=10d13b","giusepperiso__",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2023-06-07T10:41:34.000Z","17982483866483886","0","https://scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/354022824_574404671544542_3926759465901151361_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=xkyliwT_cnkQ7kNvgGc8ggk&_nc_gid=8cee68997b634daaa441f9d459debbf9&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDYyclSH_k9DrD5cbYf8P_-hujn1Nxj8NkaBlEdYjT2sQ&oe=6716CC0C&_nc_sid=10d13b","cindusso",,,,,,,,"0","This…..","2023-05-31T12:39:19.000Z","17979047153054598","0","https://scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/355074000_277828501485163_4156060152733662312_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=SkaLqq46ClcQ7kNvgHXnA6-&_nc_gid=8cee68997b634daaa441f9d459debbf9&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDSqQds_wwDwMoQGidzfH7UAnoamSLK1CzovF-OMoWOzQ&oe=6716CB1C&_nc_sid=10d13b","maria.amavida",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️","2023-05-20T23:35:01.000Z","17894978033800250","0","https://scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/456627807_2229127690772915_3011513965883973737_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=CVdk0tCmH-sQ7kNvgHAnTST&_nc_gid=8cee68997b634daaa441f9d459debbf9&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBDbWguNRhtN55-5HSCT9A247e6tkka1dR14c2F1H0SaA&oe=6716DE30&_nc_sid=10d13b","oohsoovee","0","❤️❤️❤️","2023-05-17T20:03:55.000Z","17980357190152980","0","https://scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/59857952_396744667831272_6655341739739447296_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=8slgDs724dAQ7kNvgEUZ2l7&_nc_gid=8cee68997b634daaa441f9d459debbf9&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCAvoJrta-n4D2Slh6afAzs8fiMaap2Xofh8mgzgERu1A&oe=6716E290&_nc_sid=10d13b","_simplyshanel_",,,,,,,,"0","“She touched my face. “❤️❤️❤️","2023-05-08T17:09:35.000Z","17853839096959826","4","https://scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/451553858_3356682484634481_3538973469515634300_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-man2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=gwbTFutSqkwQ7kNvgHyxkZv&_nc_gid=8cee68997b634daaa441f9d459debbf9&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAOnOesPKRMu51zt0Jqg17uGrQaTU-AWiiQTQfw6RoOvA&oe=6716DBF0&_nc_sid=10d13b","kristenavianola",,,,,,,,"0","When I had my first child, my mom drove to Texas from Louisiana to be by my side in the delivery room.

But my father also said this: don’t let people smell your money. I didn’t know what he meant. But what he meant is: when you have things, don’t announce it. Because once you announce it, people smell it. The aroma gets in them, and they start to make it theirs. They’ll start to think: I need it more than him, he can give some to me. And they’ll come up with a thousand reasons to get it from you. Don’t get me wrong, they’re real reasons. But six months later: here comes another one. You’d think that the more you do, the less you’ll need to do. But it doesn’t seem to work that way. With a lot of people, the more you do, the more they seem to need. It’s not good psychologically. And it’s not good economically. For my whole life I’ve been the person people come to. But I’m almost sixty now. I’m not where I want to be, so I’m slowing down on the giving. I still want to be a part of the whole thing: pay it forward, be blessed to be a blessing. God is love, but God is also discernment. And I can’t let other people’s emergencies cause me to have an emergency.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1376","1080","1080","https://scontent-qro1-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/324223544_914013153344083_4685796605909126368_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-qro1-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=AxtSrlxBno4Q7kNvgG8mXDk&_nc_gid=3c38ac009215462990ce6023a8b4573b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCHCz85ZP9KBMaYu-CXdh61N9pCIleWWxAw4tUu7F-hVw&oe=6716EBEE&_nc_sid=10d13b","Amen to that 👏","3012712905913789049",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18260611774088117","0","https://scontent-qro1-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/457730519_1573091123277518_5372592410550843160_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-qro1-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=0ZuhdL49y6kQ7kNvgFMqdic&_nc_gid=3c38ac009215462990ce6023a8b4573b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA_uv5bC968Li_PSwDIlQ8mKt65mY1nbaGba7dikWr_pg&oe=6716B848&_nc_sid=10d13b","stella_novela",,,,,,,,"0","Amen to that 👏","2023-08-20T07:27:48.000Z","17972310629219509","3","https://scontent-qro1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/344818961_773564037536196_3877191659514918067_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-qro1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=PhX2-FI4u1AQ7kNvgH8tO4t&_nc_gid=3c38ac009215462990ce6023a8b4573b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC3nh7rPIBl9BVTFZ6JhfdnwBkGRQGICOC4hNavTfzYAQ&oe=6716C49A&_nc_sid=10d13b","gracias_amor_1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","You cannot pour from a cup that is empty.

I’ll go in his room and give him a kiss on the forehead. Now if I was to try this during the day—he’d never allow it. He’d push me away. But if I catch him right when he wakes up, he’s disoriented. I think he forgets who he is for a second. And he’ll hug me like he doesn’t want me to leave. Next year he’s going to college. I don’t like it. It went too fast. It flew. We celebrated my 50th birthday last year. That was a big one for me; it was a birthday my father never saw. We took a trip to Philadelphia: all three of us. Tabatha booked us a nice hotel with an infinity pool. It was just a short trip, and the next morning we drove home. I’m coming out the elevator, with all of our luggage, when I hear a ruckus in the hallway. I’m thinking it's kids. I’m thinking the neighbor’s kids are playing in the hall again. But then I turn around, and it’s all of them: Nona, Steve, Anthony, all the nieces and nephews. They’re filming me and giggling like crazy. I go in the apartment and there’s decorations everywhere. A beautiful cake. My mother cooked my favorite braciole. In the living room there’s a bunch of gifts. I sit down on the couch to open them, and Tabatha slides a Bluetooth speaker next to me. It’s playing Billy Joel songs: Rootbeer Rag, Nocturne. Some of my favorites. But different versions, with different chords. When the final present is opened, I give a little speech. I thank everyone for coming. Then it was time for the braciole. I started heading for the kitchen, when Jack says: ‘Wait. There’s more.’ My niece disappears into the bedroom, and comes back with our electronic keyboard. She sets it down in the middle of the room. And Jack takes a seat. And he begins to play. The left hand running down the keys. The right hand running up the keys, playing the happy notes. I sit back on the couch and I start to lose it. Nobody else knows what’s happening. They’re confused. It’s just a song to them. They’re looking at me like I have seventeen heads. They couldn’t know. He actually did it. My boy. To make me happy. To make me say wow. My boy. My beautiful boy. My beautiful, beautiful, baby boy.”","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.

"Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","(14/15) “Never once have I called him by his real name. He’s even saved in my phone as Santa. He has a house up north somewhere. I’ll go months without hearing from him, but then he’ll text. And it’s never just a text. It’s a long paragraph, starting with: ‘Hello my friend, I hope your beautiful family is doing well.’ One year I had an idea. I told him: ‘We do this thing on Christmas Eve, called The Feast of The Seven Fishes. We’d love to have you.’ I thought for sure he’d say no. But he replied: ‘Let me think about it.’ A week passes. Then one night I’m in my make-up chair, and two white gloves fall upon my shoulders. It was a serious thing. He bends down, looks at me in the mirror, and says: ‘Yes!’ From that moment we started to plan. On Christmas Eve I got to Nonna’s house early. I told her: ‘Ma, a coworker is coming over dressed as Santa—to surprise the kids.’ She says: ‘Wouldn’t that be amazing!’ And goes back to cooking. At 5:30 Santa finishes his final shift at Macy’s. He hops on The Brooklyn Polar Express, only this time it’s going the opposite way. Back to my childhood home. Right as we finish dinner, I get a text that he’s in position. I pull my mother aside. I say: ‘We gotta to do it now,’ and I go into the bedroom. When I come back I’m dressed as an elf. I gather everyone in the living room. I say: ‘As all of you know, Nonna has been making Christmas special our entire lives.’ Then I hit ‘play’ on the TV. I had it all queued up. The Thanksgiving Day Parade—the exact moment, when Santa comes into Herald Square. I pause right on a close-up of his face. ‘Tonight,’ I say. ‘We do something special for her.’ And then we hear it. The sound of bells. It's coming from the front porch. Everyone’s like: ‘What’s that?’ Then the sound of his laugh: ‘Ho, ho, ho.’ It's echoing, it’s beautiful. It’s in a forest filled with snow. My mother says: ‘Who’s that?’ She’s smiling. She thinks she’s in on the dupe. She goes to the door, opens it up, and she starts to say: ‘He came!’ But she chokes on the words. Her eyes begin to fill with tears. She looks straight at me, and says: ‘Who is that?’ I say: ‘It’s Santa Claus, Ma.’ She says: ‘Which one?’ And I say: ‘The only one.’”","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12,

"Photo by Humans of New York on December 21, 2022. फ़ोटो के बारे में कोई जानकारी नहीं दी गई है..","Just returned from Ghana where @pninson held the grand opening of the @dikancenter last weekend-- barely a year after our fundraiser. Our man does not mess around! The city of Accra turned out in force. It was so nice to meet the community of Ghanaian leaders, businesspeople, and artists that have gathered in support of Paul. (A special thanks to the legendary @amoakoboafo for his support.) The library looks beautiful, and Paul has begun to plan the programming for under-served African artists. There’s a special Story Lab waiting to be filled with computers and cameras. Paul is doing his best to preserve his limited capital. I’d love to see Apple and Canon step up here. A bit surprised by the walls he’s hitting there; thought for sure they’d want to play a meaningful role in this emerging hub of African visual storytelling. But as Paul has shown, he’ll carry the torch alone if needed. (He’s currently in physical therapy for the back injury he received from carrying so many books.) Paul is taking a few days off for Christmas-- the first break he’s had in over a year. Enjoy your time with family, my friend. You deserve it. And congratulations on this magnificent achievement. It’s going to change a lot of lives.","Photo by Humans of New York on December 21, 2022. फ़ोटो के बारे में कोई जानकारी नहीं दी गई

"Photo by Humans of New York on January 18, 2023.","“I used to be the one that people came to for everything. Recently my sister Ayla turned sixteen, and I helped her get a job at the sneaker store I used to work at. So there’s still some stuff I can do. But not a lot. I was at the bodega earlier today, trying to reach for shit. A complete stranger had to help me. I know it’s a great thing to help someone who’s disabled, or elderly. I used to do it all the time. But I’d always feel bad for that person. And that’s what I don’t want. I don’t want people feeling bad for me. Maybe it’s a man thing, or a pride thing. But I just rearranged my whole apartment by myself, in a fucking wheelchair. Not to bother people. Not to have anyone feel bad for me. Sometimes I’ll break down, but I do it by myself. Mainly at night. And even then-- I’ll give myself probably five, ten minutes to feel bad, but that’s it. I’ll start to think about my family. Like, I care about myself. But I care about my family so much more. And I know they wouldn’t want me in this place, so that’s what really pulls me through. I’ll try to think of happy memories. I used to think of shit that happened before the wheelchair, but then it’d be like: ‘Damn. I might not be able to do that again.’ So you know what I do now? I think about happy stuff that’s happened since I’ve been in the wheel chair. Recently my sister had her sweet sixteen party; I was actually scheduled to start radiation, but I made the doctor reschedule. Because I didn’t want to miss the party. I didn’t want everyone being like: ‘Where’s Craig? Where’s Craig?’ I didn’t want Ayla explaining my situation, thinking about my situation. So I made sure to go to that party. All my boys came through; they all knew my sister since she was young. The whole vibe was good. Nothing felt forced. I didn’t get treated no different. On the last song of the night, they dragged me out on the dance floor. And I popped up a wheelie. The DJ was yelling: ‘Don’t drop him! Don’t drop him!’ I was a bottle of Hennessy in, so I almost busted my ass. My friends were laughing at me, talking shit. Just like they always do. And that’s exactly what I wanted. Like—I’m in this situation. But I’m still me. I’m still Craig.”","Photo by Humans of New York on January 18,

"Photo by Humans of New York on December 15, 2022.","One of the coolest parts of Humans of New York in the early days was HONY For The Holidays where we’d match up people with nowhere to go on Christmas with people who had an extra place at their table. The idea originated from my first year in NYC, when I didn’t know anyone, and didn’t have money to go back home—so I spent Christmas Eve at a 24-hour diner. (I say that only because there is no shame if you don’t have anywhere to go. We all have seasons.) My lovely wife Erin handled the matching and logistics for the initiative, on top of her main gig saving the lives of one gajillion senior dogs at @susiesseniordogs. But over the years the Stanton household grew, way led on to way, and alas, the HONY For The Holidays candle flickered out. But hark, hark! Hear ye angels sing. Our patron saint Mary O has decided to host her own HONY for the Holidays Dinner at @maryosirishpub this year, on Christmas Day. And boy is she excited. Giddy, really. Rarely is Mary not merry. But this is a very merry, very cheery Mary. In fact I'm 90 percent sure she's crying right now as she reads this. ⁣
⁣
Mary would like to invite anyone who has nowhere to go this Christmas to join her for this magical event. There is currently room for 45 people. That was Mary O’s idea, because: ‘It’s not a round number. And that makes it seem like really something. Ya know?’ She will be cooking herself. I tried to force catering on her, because she’s STILL baking scones 18 hours a day, but she said: ‘That just doesn't feel right. It wouldn’t be the same, ya know?’ (This is coincidentally the same reason she gave for baking one million scones herself. She's nearly 80 percent through, for anyone still waiting: 'But my hand has touched each one.')⁣
 ⁣
If for any reason you find yourself alone this holiday season, and are in the NYC area, please email a little about yourself and your situation to honyassist@gmail.com. And we'll try to get you a spot at Mary O's. We'll fit as many as we can.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"614","1080","1080","https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/320097567_2450726288420723_1572850019648785498_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=h_IFYSWUlowQ7kNvgHx8Cil&_nc_gid=fcc53abcd4d14416bd430c87986a9aee&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDCGb9b2qs2Me-0RsxMZ8bZsJOqzVMenTlpT8Hh9zN2yQ&oe=6716C94F&_nc_sid=10d13b","Such a nice act from somebody that deeply cares about stranger.

"Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","(9/15) “Every Santa gets a handler: to walk him to his chair, to bring him water, to give him Tic Tacs. But nothing in Santaland is called by its actual name. Santa handlers are called straw bosses. It’s an old circus term, for people who handle the elephants. I made sure that my straw boss knew: when the Tammaro family arrives, bring them straight to my house. My son came bounding in first. He was four years old. He jumped in my lap and started telling me his list. But in the middle he stops, and says: ‘Hey! You sound like my Daddy!’ I started to panic. That’s when my brother Steve stepped in. He said: ‘It doesn’t sound like your Daddy, Jack.’ And I made it through the rest of the visit. But I never risked it again. I didn’t want to ruin the magic. Jack would write these letters to Santa. He never went straight to the toys. He’d write things like: ‘How is your wife? Are the reindeer OK? Did you go on vacation?’ Only then would he get to the list. He had such empathy. I like to think we had something to do with it. The way we are at home. We don’t like to argue. We keep it calm, cool, and collected. We have this thing called ‘Family Sandwich.’ One day Tabatha and I were hugging in the kitchen, and Jack came running up behind us, and hugged us both. He screamed ‘family sandwich!’ And it stuck. We still do it today. I was never a sports dad. But that’s ok, because he wasn’t a sports kid. We loved doing legos. In the beginning he’d just watch me do them. But as he got a little older, we started doing them together. The holidays were always rough for me. It was the busiest time a year at both my jobs, so I’d barely be home. Jack and I would be watching a holiday movie on the couch, his head on my chest, and I’d have to get up to go to work. He’d pull me down by the shirt and say: ‘Don’t go.’ He knew that I worked at Macy’s during Christmastime. But I told him that I worked in Men’s shoes. I told him that I needed the extra money to buy everyone presents. Every day when I started my shift at Santaland, I’d take a little lego Santa that we’d built together, and I’d place it on the shelf. All the elves knew. The lego Santa—that was Jack. It was to remind me of my boy.”","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319061015_195271903014821_1605986354300847391_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=dna_YJKdrS4Q7kNvgEy8_qj&_nc_gid=44a67b8c4d3348b68978bcbd73b03a4b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBTWAJbUxPuoHK-hfP4APjWWUlBcGsIl6VpLidRmTv4IQ&oe=6716EC2E&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991876758400703349",,,"CmFSA9kOJt1",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmFSA9kOJt1/","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319279110_607633491364559_1832568561558533135_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=s69H_r-nju0Q7kNvgGjwCr-&_nc_gid=44a67b8c4d3348b68978bcbd73b03a4b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB7r4E7V5C_THfZV4bST-j7Czu8OViE1PoMU8BIUCOViA&oe=6716EF2A&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991876758342092619",,,"CmFSA9gukdL",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmFSA9gukdL/",,,,"Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","320","320","https://scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319774368_833951161174719_5450693693269220987_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=N_k3SAUSgw0Q7kNvgHguuDc&_nc_gid=44a67b8c4d3348b68978bcbd73b03a4b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC7VxJQjJdfA58gtqx-vfo3Rw6k1dyd5qNcNVGPii8Ikw&oe=6716E40D&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991876758333575841",,,"CmFSA9gOFKh",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmFSA9gOFKh/",,,,"Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319527691_197084246210828_6370812921067086934_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=79P-8Z0hqmgQ7kNvgFUncJM&_nc_gid=44a67b8c4d3348b68978bcbd73b03a4b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDWtO-BWGnxwi-GGGoag6tyLJnT9w_ogvi0KoFnnDLEkw&oe=6716C35E&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991876758342130831",,,"CmFSA9gutyP",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmFSA9gutyP/","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319088051_478103004433682_1422466257186262302_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=bSCBliifCNIQ7kNvgEFHG5-&_nc_gid=44a67b8c4d3348b68978bcbd73b03a4b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAYB04dXxsp_da0vGxHG7afaW68qs8Vp95n4b-qHa3hnw&oe=6716B950&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991876758442807694",,,"CmFSA9muxGO",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmFSA9muxGO/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"208","1080","1080","https://scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319061015_195271903014821_1605986354300847391_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=dna_YJKdrS4Q7kNvgEy8_qj&_nc_gid=44a67b8c4d3348b68978bcbd73b03a4b&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBTWAJbUxPuoHK-hfP4APjWWUlBcGsIl6VpLidRmTv4IQ&oe=6716EC2E&_nc_sid=10d13b","WE STILL DO IT TODAY.

"Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","(4/15) “There’s a Christopher Reeve movie, called Somewhere In Time. About a playwright who time travels. He goes back to 1912, and meets this girl, and falls in love. I watched it as a little kid. And when it was over I ran straight to my mom; I’m in tears. I said: ‘What if the girl I’m supposed to meet lives in another time?’ It really scared me. Because my biggest dream was to become a father. Not just a father; a dad, a daddy. There’s a difference. My father was a father: he’d go to work, come home, watch tv. On Saturday if the weather was warm he’d hose the sidewalk in his shorts. Just a regular Italian guy. Life is different when you have aspirations, and he didn’t have aspirations. But he was nice. That’s one thing he always told me: Life is easier when you’re nice. My father was always the first person I showed my magic tricks. I wanted to mess them up with him, so they’d be absolutely perfect when I showed my mom. My mom Stella. Now there was a person with aspirations. Her whole life she’d wanted to be a mother. It’s all she cared about. And all I cared about was making her say: ‘Wow.’ There was one trick she absolutely loved. Each person starts with a deck of cards. Choose a card from your deck, put it back, shuffle, and switch decks. Then each person finds their card. I’d always say the same thing: ‘Wouldn’t it be amazing if we had the same card?’ And we always did. Stupidest trick anyone can do. But it absolutely floored her. She gave the trick a name: ‘Wouldn’t it be Amazing?’’ And at every family gathering, there’d always be a point where she’d say: ‘Johnny, Johnny, do Wouldn’t It Be Amazing!’ She was the perfect spectator. Never wanted to know the secret. Only wanted to be amazed. Eventually my tricks got good enough that I started doing birthday parties. My first car had a personalized plate that said: ‘MAJICK.’ I put a whole show together; I’d do the first half as Bruce Wayne, and the second half as Batman. One afternoon I’m in my bedroom, getting ready for a party. Taking my box apart, organizing my silks. When suddenly I hear a knock on the door. Not the side door. The front door, which was very strange. Because we never used the front door.”","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319832646_1226628234930372_4351201372218519821_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=qEWTO2Lw0goQ7kNvgGWTbXl&_nc_gid=34d51ba4c22a4d2ca12feec03aa43049&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBrLe51sMuoBQVHzagXjZh_fQw4ZKVgNNydraCf8FEMsg&oe=6716E485&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991757752373285876",,,"CmE29MkOxP0",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmE29MkOxP0/","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319106913_1429561157570562_1313237950586706101_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=D_8Q5GzIykAQ7kNvgEKvSd-&_nc_gid=34d51ba4c22a4d2ca12feec03aa43049&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCkmSal1NK3B63LOmvfk6eE1u5LdVjTckGKKt7As5L0Tw&oe=6716DEB1&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991757752381616616",,,"CmE29MkujHo",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmE29MkujHo/",,,,"Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319085929_2033953900135684_6819834784284507304_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=TtZLY7AGJQcQ7kNvgH25q_Y&_nc_gid=34d51ba4c22a4d2ca12feec03aa43049&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDt9zRl7vGWNZ3mAahknoKBWevrePcEamF-0EuFxs_1zw&oe=6716E7F9&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991757752373314103",,,"CmE29MkO4I3",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmE29MkO4I3/",,,,"Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319316434_100391316258840_6323073726400508382_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=tOx4xOx6PEUQ7kNvgHhYu8r&_nc_gid=34d51ba4c22a4d2ca12feec03aa43049&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCFXAIGh4SMbEvXncGD_jW3SyEPos7SszfCHoCRZOOXlw&oe=6716D8D2&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991757752440216937",,,"CmE29MoOF1p",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmE29MoOF1p/","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319536967_536857041420199_8305924552958937810_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=bMvfx_rah0cQ7kNvgF7WHRh&_nc_gid=34d51ba4c22a4d2ca12feec03aa43049&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCJ6l4NlpTkbv5OBUrSLo1omkiP9fwQY47zLR1bKMlnZw&oe=6716ED28&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991757752364747229",,,"CmE29MjuMnd",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmE29MjuMnd/","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","750","750","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319064495_2194694144070863_1208526323334364195_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=iJbMKEZPWOUQ7kNvgGIyzR3&_nc_gid=34d51ba4c22a4d2ca12feec03aa43049&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD_XasvUsBSXkMcQr61zmBB0DL52dE7B3c3qb7ZwOB3lw&oe=6716E8F6&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991757752381713967",,,"CmE29Mku64v",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmE29Mku64v/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"223","1080","1080","https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319832646_1226628234930372_4351201372218519821_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=qEWTO2Lw0goQ7kNvgGWTbXl&_nc_gid=34d51ba4c22a4d2ca12feec03aa43049&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBrLe51sMuoBQVHzagXjZh_fQw4ZKVgNNydraCf8FEMsg&oe=6716E485&_nc_sid=10d13b","""Life's different when you have aspirations.""

"Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","(3/15) “We lived in a house that my great grandfather bought in the 1930’s. My mother was in charge of decorating. Every room she’d fill with little tchotchkes: santa on a ladder, santa on the beach, santa on skis. There was a banner in the living room with every photo we’d taken at Macy’s. And below that we’d lean my grandfather’s cane against the wall. It was our own little homage to Miracle on 34th Street. We’d watch it every year on Channel 11. My mother cried through the whole thing. But the final scene we loved most of all. When the little girl—the one who never believed—finally gets her house. And Kris Kringle’s cane is leaning against the fireplace. The movie ends with a question: Was he real? Or was he not? We didn’t have a fireplace in our house. So we set our milk and cookies by a pipe in the kitchen. Christmas Eve in an Italian family. It’s very big. We call it The Feast of The Seven Fishes. We never had exactly seven, but we’d cook Scungilli, Whiting, Calamari. After dinner my mother would set aside time for me to do my magic. Back then it was simple stuff: card tricks, silk scarves, sponge rabbits. But not for long, not for long. That night I was too excited to sleep. I could see myself on the stage of my school’s auditorium. I could picture the faces of my classmates: everyone cheering, everyone amazed. Look at Johnny! Real parlor tricks! A professional magician! All of a sudden I’m snapped back to real life by a ruckus in the hallway. It’s coming from the front door. Very strange, because we only use the side door. I crawl out of bed and peek into the hallway. Could it be? The Big Man himself? With a bulging sack of magic tricks? No, no. It's my mother and father. With Mary and Joe from next door, and they’re carrying bags. Big bags, full of stuff. And it begins to click. The whole thing is a dupe! A parlor trick! Just then my youngest brother Anthony wakes up. He says: ‘Johnny, Johnny-- is it Santa?’ I’m about to tell him. But that’s when I see it. This little blue and white bike, with training wheels, and a six on the front. I pull the door shut, and say: ‘Not yet, Anthony. It’s just Mary and Joe, coming to visit. Let’s go back to sleep.’”","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319303339_198707499388564_5775875950090554484_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=AGG1RSesuHcQ7kNvgHmybc-&_nc_gid=26d9b3c155874c5ab408b328a3d49e74&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA9634UDmHOn_T1vn1YEddZFL05-1rZdVSAvg3s-a7ynQ&oe=6716EC66&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991723599656504243",,,"CmEvMNXrcuz",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmEvMNXrcuz/","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319085310_5859924644099496_8175898231255141280_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=d00UaPW0zCgQ7kNvgE74Sm2&_nc_gid=26d9b3c155874c5ab408b328a3d49e74&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAZEIYEkandrlxINW7Em4VfrO6mdfseEJJWOZWRnScRDA&oe=6716DB85&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991723599681776898",,,"CmEvMNZL20C",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmEvMNZL20C/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"283","1080","1080","https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319303339_198707499388564_5775875950090554484_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=AGG1RSesuHcQ7kNvgHmybc-&_nc_gid=26d9b3c155874c5ab408b328a3d49e74&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA9634UDmHOn_T1vn1YEddZFL05-1rZdVSAvg3s-a7ynQ&oe=6716EC66&_nc_sid=10d13b","This has my tearing up crying a whole year later 🥺😭 keeping the magic alive for his brother","2991723605478250039","https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319303339_198707499388564_5775875950090554484_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=AGG1RSesuHcQ7kNvgHmybc-&_nc_gid=26d9b3c155874c5ab408b328a3d49e74&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA9634UDmHOn_T1vn1YEddZFL05-1rZdVSAvg3s-a7ynQ&oe=6716EC66&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319085310_5859924644099496_8175898231255141280_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=d00UaPW0zCgQ7kNvgE74Sm2&_nc_gid=26d9b3c155874c5ab408b328a3d49e74&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAZEIYEkandrlxINW7Em4VfrO6mdfseEJJWOZWRnScRDA&oe=6716DB85&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18027819643764892","0","https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/308802583_849245282769190_503552183965132674_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=nWRQ05jTTOYQ7kNvgEg4_7k&_nc_gid=26d9b3c155874c5ab408b328a3d49e74&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDlcHq3VWIiSNm0eRcwvl8_fqxw2BAVMOds0lnkdKQwiw&oe=6716C7D3&_nc_sid=10d13b","tori_mbone",,,,,,,,"0","This has my tearing up crying a whole year later 🥺😭 keeping the magic alive for his brother","2023-12-14T17:52:07.000Z","18017442565496858","2","https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/273248119_484898333176619_1070664092992317512_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=i9PjzmqkiRoQ7kNvgHMzlMV&_nc_gid=26d9b3c155874c5ab408b328a3d49e74&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCymLEyFbS_aWBbVUCm22LNABpB70Ka5-7Netewm9sN8g&oe=6716CAD3&_nc_sid=10d13b","thoughtbin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","The BEST BIG BRO in the world!!!👏😍","2023-01-26T22:21:20.000Z","17953249688366465","0","https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/123703915_159901052483883_5619752191529601148_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=WcnSUONO7VgQ7kNvgE58Uwo&_nc_gid=26d9b3c155874c5ab408b328a3d49e74&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB7aE9ludZgOl6Y7OvdHPPqo2X7oj-pWOmpSR_BywwaNQ&oe=6716BEFA&_nc_sid=10d13b","lizdavis_halfdozen",,,,,,,,"0","What I find amazing is that he still believed at 12 years old. I have a 12 year old and I’m not sure if it’s just because the world is different but I can’t imagine him believing in Santa Claus or even my 10 year old. I think my four year old likes to pretend and my eight-year-old definitely likes to pretend. I’m just wondering if maybe it was a time when kids could believe just a little bit longer than they can nowadays.  I would think all sorts of kids would ruin it at school by 12 years old. But the way he protected his little brothers is extremely sweet. We are going to an event that we usually go to before Christmas. My 12 year old is already doing the mental gymnastics because there’s usually a Santa Claus that we whisper into a microphone the names of our children and he yells them out from the rooftops. He’s already worried how we’re going to explain that to the little one but I said I don’t think at four he’s gonna remember next year it’ll be back to business as usual.  Meaning he might say merry Christmas in certain name but he’s not gonna connect that it was supposed to be before Christmas I think I’ll just think it’s him yelling from a rooftop and think that’s cool because how in the world is he reading his name from a big long list.","2022-12-28T20:16:17.000Z","17960889095048720","3","https://scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/313848411_464102929044079_1761285218879986836_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=W_Jah4fvgqQQ7kNvgHuKGKr&_nc_gid=26d9b3c155874c5ab408b328a3d49e74&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBSwLm9e8qXNgEHe2PhX2R-vWOXoAg5UqyCyVl_KghTqQ&oe=6716BE1B&_nc_sid=10d13b","kingkaren13_",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Ok but the fact that you didn’t let your little brother find out the truth on the very same night as you did, just completely warms my heart.

"Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","(13/15) “There’s a pep rally at the beginning of every season. Everyone’s there: the white flowers, the straw bosses, the elves. First we go through all the Human Resources stuff. Then the person on stage will pause, and say: ‘Do I hear jingle bells?’ And everyone goes crazy. Then he explodes into the room, wearing full parade suit. He makes his way to the stage. He recites The Night Before Christmas; everybody’s crying. Then we all line up, we go through the maze, and everyone has their own private visit with Santa. Look, I know who it is. I’ve had coffee with him. But this mask of sparkle and tinsel comes over my eyes; and I just see Santa. I’ve asked him for some very personal things. Not things, things. Things you can’t hold. On the night Jack learned it was all a dupe, I was a nervous wreck. A white flower came into my house, and whispered in my ear: ‘They’re here.’ I took a deep breath. And prepared to tell my son that I’ve been lying to him his entire life. Jack comes in wearing my old leather jacket. And Tabatha’s red scarf. I say: ‘Hello, Merry Christmas.’ And right away, he knows. He says: ‘What the hell, Dad?’ I pat the bench next to me, and motion for him to sit down. I say: ‘Hey buddy, what’s up?’ He’s just looking at me. I show him the Lego Santa on the shelf. I say: ‘I want you to know that I haven’t been working in men’s shoes these last ten years.’ And he goes: ‘Really?’ And I see it. I see it starting to click. ‘You’re right,’ I tell him. ‘It’s impossible for Santa to do what he does in one night. But he did exist. His name was St. Nicholas. And he was so kind, and so giving, that his legend grew over hundreds of years. And now during Christmas, we keep his spirit alive by becoming Santa Claus. Not only am I Santa Claus, but Mommy is Santa Claus. And Nonna is Santa Claus. And Uncle Steve is Santa Claus. And Uncle Anthony is Santa Claus. And now, because you’re of age, I’ve brought you here. To bestow the power of Santa Claus onto you.’ He started to cry. And I started to cry. And the elves started crying, and the white flower, and the straw boss. Then I looked up. It couldn’t be. A Christmas miracle. I said: ‘Tabatha, babe. Are you cwying?’”","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12,

"Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","(12/15) “He was just a man. St. Nicholas was just a man in a village, who gave presents to children. But he was so kind that people remembered his story. They called him Santa. And in 1862 RH Macy put an ad in the paper, saying that Santa had come to his store. That’s how it all began: one man, one chair. Since that day only 275 men have worn this suit. And not to toot my own horn; but what I do, as this man, I take it very, very seriously. Every time you put on your suit, you get ‘fluffed’ by the make-up people. Some guys need 5 or 10 minutes—something is always off. But not me. When I stand in front of them—they don’t touch me. They say: ‘Thank you.’ I take a moment to myself. I picture all the people I’m going to see that night, and I make it my business. For every single one of them to believe. I muster up all the joy and hope and wonder that I have in my being. All of my Christmas, I pour into this man. And I dupe them all: the kids, the adults. Especially the adults. Kids believe automatically. It’s the adults that need it; they need to believe. Sometimes I’ll get a call from a friend. They’ll say: ‘Johnny, my daughter is eleven. She’s on the fence. Can I bring her in?’ And when she comes to see Santa—I know her name, where she lives, how she’s doing in school. And my friend has their beautiful little child believing for one more year. Just one more year. It’s such a short time. From one to five you have them. In all their innocence. Before it starts to click in: the real life, the adulthood. First it's only a glimpse; and it clicks back. You get them back. But each year it clicks back less and less. Until it doesn’t click back. Until your baby boy, the only one you’ve got, comes home from school and says: ‘Dad, my friends and I have been talking. And it’s logistically impossible for Santa to do all of that in a single night.’ And I knew. I knew I couldn’t hold him any longer. I went into the bedroom. Tabatha took one look at my face, and said ‘What’s up?’ I said: ‘I think our son just told me he doesn’t believe in Santa.’ And she said: ‘Thank God.’ And we laughed for a second. Then I said: ‘It’s over. This year, when he comes to Santa—he comes to me.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"395","1080","1080","https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319135086_864679084582594_5108621241051380786_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=natzT97zMA8Q7kNvgEWYuzy&_nc_gid=e9c6ee3c95ce4ca7acbd0836243d0921&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBybXR0w4EDN9_H3ooNSu26VONGdXtPGvJB9DQnsSBqwg&oe=6716EE76&_nc_sid=10d13b","@ersullie ❤️ this brought a tear to my eye.

When one day I’d come home from school, and shout: ‘I’m home!’ And my voice would echo through the house. It meant the decorations had been taken down. And Christmas was gone for another year. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I have a problem with nostalgia. It’s hard to explain; it’s like I base my whole life on the past. I have this longing and this need for how things used to be. I want it back. All of it: every parade, every Miracle on 34th, every Feast of The Seven Fishes, every Wouldn’t it Be Amazing. I don’t want to get old. I don’t want to leave. I don’t want anyone leaving me. Tabatha tells me: think about all the good stuff that’s still going to happen. We get to watch him graduate high school. And college. He’s going to meet someone. We get to see all that. And it does help me, when I focus on the future. But it hurts a little too. Because Jack is almost the same age as I was when my father passed away. And that makes me sad. Sad and scared. But then the end of November rolls around again. Time for my first shift. I’ll jump on the N-Train. I’ll listen to my playlist of 1140 Christmas songs. And here comes the euphoria. The right hand running up the keys. Up, up, up, until the stairs turn to wood. And poof. It’s a time machine. Suddenly it’s all in front of me again. It’s a magic trick, a dupe. I know what it is, but I never want it to end. I asked the real Santa for advice one time. We met for coffee at the Times Square McDonald’s, and I asked him: ‘How do you handle it? How do you handle when it all comes to an end?’ And you know what he told me? He said that Christmas Eve is the hardest day of the year for him. His final shift at Macy’s ends at 5:30. He goes to mass, and then he goes home. And he spends the evening alone. I never imagined. I thought I loved Christmas. But it’s so much bigger for him. He has a real beard. I never imagined what it must be like for Santa himself. “It’s hard for me too,” he said. “But I’ve never had a beautiful family like you.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"354","1080","1080","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319068233_830255554721212_3679761841304714382_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=VVIJ5zvaZxYQ7kNvgGEB4Pe&_nc_gid=523ef6fc24414a77bfff67ec2edda780&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCrBPzuStx3Xin0viAaXa-G9AyTI1GDUEUdG4pR1E4txA&oe=6716D47B&_nc_sid=10d13b","@natemp777","2991912518859793334",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17994546455222624","0","https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/436163772_947321203462722_5160983352020081720_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=v1LUd5yAR6kQ7kNvgH9wQW3&_nc_gid=523ef6fc24414a77bfff67ec2edda780&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCCAuO6K3S3Gz10nfvfkCU5qK_AQDm5s6xxzhK_lgWvrw&oe=6716D753&_nc_sid=10d13b","shamiransaliba",,,,,,,,"0","@natemp777","2023-12-20T20:25:29.000Z","17998699711831843","0","https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/460755293_1065878021610956_1224974328395290150_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=014IaXZxSKkQ7kNvgHxPKk5&_nc_gid=523ef6fc24414a77bfff67ec2edda780&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAAwpVTBYbo92MYTQn8AENnbOOnQgOqBQKEYfsnCK5uMw&oe=6716E688&_nc_sid=10d13b","sydruhroh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","can we please get the link to the playlist of 1140 Christmas songs tho 🥹","2023-05-12T01:42:24.000Z","17994426490634194","1","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/462917587_1562874851283743_5468845318563439526_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=KicqWh3YruYQ7kNvgFP8WCI&_nc_gid=523ef6fc24414a77bfff67ec2edda780&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDRdf1YanSaA54vfmXBGp_Uj5YTP3Mw_mcakVqFWy6XyQ&oe=6716C2F3&_nc_sid=10d13b","crysty__marie",,,,,,,,"0","Whew tears, I get it.

When they start to click over into adulthood; it’s like a little death. I’ll never forget the day I brought home a Star Wars Lego set. I poured it out on the table, and started to organize the pieces. Jack was maybe five. He pushed my hand away, and said: ‘No Daddy, I do it.’ Oh man. There should be a pamphlet for that. Don’t get me wrong, it’s amazing to watch them grow up. Every few months you get to say ‘hello’ to a new person. But you have to say goodbye too. I remember dropping Jack off for his first piano lesson. I printed out the sheet music for Summer, Highland Falls. I slipped it into his binder, and said: ‘This is Daddy’s favorite song. Wouldn’t it be amazing if you could learn it?’ He rolled his eyes. I said: ‘C’mon, just one song.’ And he’s like: ‘Dad, please stop.’ I said: ‘OK, OK. Just keep it in your binder. In case you change your mind.’ He never changed his mind. But he did start writing his own music. He’d hear a song that he liked, on YouTube, or one of his video games, and he’d lock himself in his room for hours. When he came back out he’d have a written a whole new version. With different chords. It was like: ‘Wow!’ I was proud of him, yes. Of course I was proud of him. Did I wish it had been both of us in that room, singing Summer, Highland Falls?’ Also yes. But no matter how far he clicked over into adulthood, I’d get him back for five glorious weeks a year. We didn’t have a fireplace in our apartment. We’d put the Christmas tree next to a window, and leave the window open. Jack would decorate a plate. Then on that plate we’d put out Santa’s favorite cookie—a big Linzer tart. Also happens to be my favorite cookie. I’d take a big bite of the tart and make some crumbs, and I’d drink the milk. Then the next morning he’d knock on our door at six o’clock, screaming: ‘He came! He came!’ It drove Tabatha crazy. Every Christmas, she’d say: ‘It’s out of control. You’re out of control. This is the year we have to tell him.’ Second grade, third grade, fourth grade. Every time: ‘This is the year.’ But I’d always say: ‘Not yet. When it’s time, it’s time. But one more year. Just give me one more year.”","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.

"Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","(8/15) “In late November all the Santas gather in a meeting room for breakfast and coffee. Twenty-five to thirty guys. All different races, religions, orientations. Most empathetic group of men I’ve ever met. It’s an emotional mess. We talk about why we’re there. We swap stories of special visits from the past. That first year I was the youngest one— by a lot. Everyone was grayer than me. Chubbier than me. ‘Bigger than life’ than me. All of us were given a big, huge Santa Guide. Inside it tells you everything. The history of the real St. Nicholas. How to say Merry Christmas in every language. All the ‘Do’s’ and ‘Don’ts.’ Santa doesn’t actually say ‘Ho, Ho, Ho.’ It’s a laugh. It’s how he laughs. He doesn’t sing songs. He never asks a child’s name. And Santa never, ever promises a gift. That’s a big one. One year Santa accidentally promised an iPad. And Macy’s had to buy the kid an iPad. During my training I got to observe visits from veteran Santas. I tried to pull something from each guy: a laugh from this one, a look from that one. Then finally the day came when it was my turn to put on the suit. There’s a whole Santa dressing room. All the coats are on racks. All the wigs above them. There’s a big, long make-up table. The make-up department is world class. When I put everything on for the first time, and looked into the mirror, I saw Santa. It was like: ‘Holy shit, I can do this.’ There was one other Santa in the room with me. I couldn’t see his face. The whole time his back was turned. Someone was helping him with his coat. He was being so meticulous, smoothing every wrinkle. His beard was real, but he was shaping it so carefully. Everything had to be perfect. Finally he finishes; he turns around to face me, and poof. I’m seven years old again: ‘Here he comes! Here he comes!’ It’s him. The real Santa. The one from the parade. He says: ‘Oh, hello! Are you one of my new colleagues?’ And I say: ‘Yes, are you Santa Claus?’ He says ‘I am.’ Then he says: ‘What a nice head of hair you have,’ and he walks away. My confidence disappeared. Talk about imposter syndrome. I look back in the mirror, and all I see is an Italian kid from Brooklyn. Wearing a beard.”","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319611006_171295945589453_576268001143855318_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=FuOnpW-xu8cQ7kNvgFl3DV7&_nc_gid=5d92afdd09e44ed487b13b4878867545&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA_ydeRp82SVU5etbPtG3wAYf7othuESCRFziY-KLgEvA&oe=6716EB4E&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991859689009468732",,,"CmFOIkdOFU8",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmFOIkdOFU8/","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319530375_891156228548452_3915269756016695897_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=3rlAo6u5dt8Q7kNvgFozHZn&_nc_gid=5d92afdd09e44ed487b13b4878867545&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBft4d7cCDVn8xRvP59onN1GC6SCGEY4RdUq37_NGLFyg&oe=6716E562&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991859689185780335",,,"CmFOIknuqJv",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmFOIknuqJv/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"138","1080","1080","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319611006_171295945589453_576268001143855318_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=FuOnpW-xu8cQ7kNvgFl3DV7&_nc_gid=5d92afdd09e44ed487b13b4878867545&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA_ydeRp82SVU5etbPtG3wAYf7othuESCRFziY-KLgEvA&oe=6716EB4E&_nc_sid=10d13b","hey","2991859692750984211","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319611006_171295945589453_576268001143855318_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=FuOnpW-xu8cQ7kNvgFl3DV7&_nc_gid=5d92afdd09e44ed487b13b4878867545&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA_ydeRp82SVU5etbPtG3wAYf7othuESCRFziY-KLgEvA&oe=6716EB4E&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319530375_891156228548452_3915269756016695897_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=3rlAo6u5dt8Q7kNvgFozHZn&_nc_gid=5d92afdd09e44ed487b13b4878867545&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBft4d7cCDVn8xRvP59onN1GC6SCGEY4RdUq37_NGLFyg&oe=6716E562&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17955741905401149","0","https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/329737583_154228727429496_1702400014477211765_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=conHS7YJYKIQ7kNvgEsVI7D&_nc_gid=5d92afdd09e44ed487b13b4878867545&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDYZLo-buw2LLivEX9CApROAc1_IRRHhfSgmTjMg4YkAA&oe=6716D30E&_nc_sid=10d13b","orthojointrelief",,,,,,,,"0","hey","2023-03-04T15:33:26.000Z","17973037744882574","0","https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/15048213_1917189438510110_7837854576878288896_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=zcTHJI5_XYAQ7kNvgEQNocu&_nc_gid=5d92afdd09e44ed487b13b4878867545&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCGf1bCQ-OsY7kl-bfB_I6wDYA_dbmRa4B3_XOsJEil_g&oe=6716C144&_nc_sid=10d13b","_karenrhea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","That second photo gave me chills!!!!","2023-01-11T18:11:30.000Z","17947535675313616","0","https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/461496957_474159925586442_5359565922649389185_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=rJz4p4P67cMQ7kNvgGwgwZf&_nc_gid=5d92afdd09e44ed487b13b4878867545&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD3trbP511Onw6_gO8EC3ivQagQxU85A_ovv0O5HR9StQ&oe=6716CA91&_nc_sid=10d13b","lesliej_mcg",,,,,,,,"0","To be. ‘True’ Santa I believe one must be an empath to be believable and connect.

"Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","(7/15) “Summer, Highland Falls. One of, if not the best, Billy Joel songs. Lyrically and musically. The left hand goes down the keys, playing the sad notes. The right hand goes up, playing the happy notes. There’s a point in the song where he says: ‘It’s either sadness or euphoria.’ And that’s me. That’s always been me. Tabatha calls me the sad clown. I hit a rough patch after Jack was born. Here was the thing that I’d always wanted; and there’s a cloud over me. I was filled with anxiety; I couldn’t shake it. At work I’d crawl into the closet with my walkie talkie, just to be alone. On the subway ride home I’d pull my hat over my eyes. As soon as I walked in the apartment I’d head straight to Jack’s room. I’d lay on the floor while he was napping. It calmed me down. Just to be near him. My beautiful, baby boy. He couldn’t sleep at night unless I was in the crib with him. After thirty minutes I’d try to sneak out. But his little hand would come up, and tug on my shirt. And it was back in the crib for me. Tabatha would come in at 4 AM to wake me up for work. I never wanted to miss a single moment. I’d take him to get the oil changed. I’d bundle him up, just to take him down the block. We still gathered at my mother’s house every Thanksgiving-- Anthony, Steve, all the nieces and nephews—and we’d choose a day to see Santa. Same thing every year. We’d always meet at the top of the escalators. But the year that Jack turned three, something strange happened. We were winding through the maze when an elf came bounding up to us. I recognized her; she worked with me at the toy store. She leaned in close, and said: ‘Hi Johnny! Come work with us.’ I laughed. I was thirty-eight at the time. Way too old to be an elf. But too young to be Santa. I didn’t even consider it. But six months later Tony and Tina’s Wedding gets cancelled. And the very same week I get an email from Macy’s, requesting applications for the holiday season. I’m thinking: this is crazy. I’m too young. Too skinny. And way too Italian. But when they called me in for an interview, the first question they asked was: ‘Why do you love Christmas?’ I looked down at my watch, and said: ‘How much time do you have?’”","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-den2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319341955_733524577678541_7195160869176763995_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-den2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=gvXIHQETdOYQ7kNvgEdq_X5&_nc_gid=7490a7e5320e4d5483d1ba01cb9d669d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB-wCJGOjvB51Zr-nUzbWuO5ctO2QHAOZyMrylBcCPtbA&oe=6716DB3E&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991837707224309933",,,"CmFJIsUuWCt",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmFJIsUuWCt/","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-den2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319126400_912334219764595_322232237226682585_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-den2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=ng-BlHzSeDgQ7kNvgHLsO4I&_nc_gid=7490a7e5320e4d5483d1ba01cb9d669d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCUF5pF3JghHIEq676Dv3WZCWfLRzDg8z4ZWykcTaC6AA&oe=6716DC39&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991837707283097036",,,"CmFJIsYOmXM",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmFJIsYOmXM/",,,,"Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-den2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319476891_1233581750559066_5435494792709191218_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-den2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=2C_t7ReTaaAQ7kNvgFdaGSI&_nc_gid=7490a7e5320e4d5483d1ba01cb9d669d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD20LcnC3ce1FDds0fQbLSbTzfmpzOpfYpOx0G2tynKkg&oe=6716DD16&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991837707274559677",,,"CmFJIsXuCC9",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmFJIsXuCC9/",,,,"Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-den2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319070165_704649621088276_8194960309554119125_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-den2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=bcWmbE1Gb6QQ7kNvgEuFezr&_nc_gid=7490a7e5320e4d5483d1ba01cb9d669d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAtTx-ts9rKRicm-FGTuDcTLzC4NkQOWGasoyIBotZIFg&oe=6716ED57&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991837707325040335",,,"CmFJIsaumbP",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmFJIsaumbP/","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","480","480","https://scontent-den2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319568034_835061867556603_7641306678031320537_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-den2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=2b7K-2wr5SAQ7kNvgHwR7n-&_nc_gid=7490a7e5320e4d5483d1ba01cb9d669d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCDsqzzHlXjzl0LJbgOSTh_ObLspXC-9_FsinfMVwx-qA&oe=6716C8D9&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991837707316626408",,,"CmFJIsaOgPo",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmFJIsaOgPo/","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-den2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319099944_1919479721777566_1965539907434265274_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-den2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=vk5T7ta293IQ7kNvgELyNj_&_nc_gid=7490a7e5320e4d5483d1ba01cb9d669d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBGjltAom10F71QdDEJMilY7ps-4dtMBXZLob5pfHl1Dg&oe=6716BED2&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991837707274741407",,,"CmFJIsXuuaf",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmFJIsXuuaf/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"227","1080","1080","https://scontent-den2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319341955_733524577678541_7195160869176763995_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-den2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=gvXIHQETdOYQ7kNvgEdq_X5&_nc_gid=7490a7e5320e4d5483d1ba01cb9d669d&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB-wCJGOjvB51Zr-nUzbWuO5ctO2QHAOZyMrylBcCPtbA&oe=6716DB3E&_nc_sid=10d13b","Love who you are and the Billy Joel … its either sadness or euphoria… your story is so wonderfully special.

"Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","(2/15) “Christmas, 1983. The year I learned it was all a dupe. I was twelve years old. And the holiday season began like any other. With my mother sitting me in front of the TV to watch the Thanksgiving Day parade. Every five minutes I’d run into the kitchen with updates: Mickey Mouse! Yogi Bear! But she just kept on cooking. ‘Tell me when he comes,’ she’d say. Then after what seemed like eternity-- after the Pink Panther, after the Giant Turkey, after the mayor, the marching bands, the baton twirlers—after everything that wasn’t Christmas. Poof! There he’d be. Waving down from his plastic sleigh. I’d yell into the kitchen: ‘Here he comes! Here he comes!’ And my mother would come running in, wearing her schmock, her ‘schmata,’ a wooden spoon in one hand. And her eyes would fill with tears. Santa! The real Santa. This wasn’t the Bloomingdale’s Santa. This wasn’t the Santa from King’s Plaza Mall. Those were Santa’s helpers. Santa needs helpers, he can’t be everywhere at once. Because after the parade he goes to the eighth floor of the 34th Street Macy’s. Where for five glorious weeks he collects the wishes of children. After Thanksgiving dinner we’d gather around the calendar and choose a night to go. Every single year; since I was a newborn. When the night arrived we’d pile onto the N-Train—the Brooklyn Polar Express. Drops you right across the street from Macy’s. Then it’s onto the escalators: up, up, up, until the stairs turn wooden. Santa looked a little different back then. They weren’t exactly going for authenticity. But that made no difference to my mother. She’d speak to this man like he was real: ‘Oh Santa, you look so nice. Oh Santa, we come every year.’ My two younger brothers went next. Steve asked for a baseball glove. Anthony asked for his first ever bicycle, with a basket on the front. Then it was my turn. That year I knew exactly what I wanted. I’d been seeing the commercials on TV for weeks. A full set of Tannen’s magic tricks: color-changing rabbits, disappearing coke bottles. These weren’t close-up kiddie tricks. These were real parlor tricks. Stuff that you could do on a stage. This was the year I’d finally become a real magician.”","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12,

"Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","(5/15) “It was never supposed to happen. It was summertime. He was tan. He was only forty-six. He had a heart attack at work. The policemen on our doorstep said by the time they got to him, it was too late. I’d never even been to a funeral before. First funeral I ever went to, and it’s for my own father. That was when real life started happening. My mother went to work. She got two jobs: one at the Board of Education, and another at a dentist’s office. I was the oldest son, so I figured I should take over something. To help mom figure out this road. I landed on three things: driving people everywhere, fixing things around the house, and Christmas. I wanted to do it bigger than ever. We’d never had outdoor decorations before, so I went to the discount store and got some outdoor decorations: toy soldiers for the front steps. A star for the porch. Big, chunky lights for the front gates. I hauled the boxes out of the basement and filled our living room with the usual tchotchkes. Then up went the banner, with all the pictures from Macy’s. There’s a couple photos where it’s just me and my mom. My brothers were getting a little old for it. But every year, when she asked if we were going to see Santa, I’d say: ‘Yes. Yes we are.’ Grown woman. Husband dead. And she would still speak to this man like he was real: ‘Santa, it’s been such a tough year. But we’re so happy to see you.’ I’m smiling in the photos. But things got pretty dark for me after my father’s death. I tried to keep doing magic, but my heart wasn’t in it anymore. The last show I did was at a big camp. The kids were talking through the whole show. I couldn’t amaze them. At one point I was making a ball float in the air, and this little girl yelled out: ‘You suck.’ All the kids start laughing. I said: ‘Please take a seat. That’s not very nice.’ And this girl, all of eleven years old, screamed something so graphic that it sunk into my soul. I packed up my things and walked off the stage. I’m hysterical crying. The camp director is begging me to go back out there, but I couldn’t do it. I decided right then to put the magic away. I thought that maybe children are different now. Maybe the wonder is gone for good.”","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319106914_5887420254641684_2481488813485698738_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=oFHTpb5vEIsQ7kNvgHCcG1p&_nc_gid=585c119ba244420fbea5bbf9438ac6fa&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA5Tp0L8OLyhxJ4EEGYIXAYTiurh_ECn5AHZ6dYHbIJPA&oe=6716CD52&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991783074065993989",,,"CmE8trOutEF",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmE8trOutEF/","Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319548230_1236612553585060_5026330911779227464_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=0GflxOK48Q8Q7kNvgFCcTSj&_nc_gid=585c119ba244420fbea5bbf9438ac6fa&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBGHNc4VBcnx55eDTLQwWljCUnzUygvRuAwDk5HUoExOQ&oe=6716BCC3&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2991783074074289149",,,"CmE8trPOWP9",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmE8trPOWP9/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"349","1080","1080","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319106914_5887420254641684_2481488813485698738_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=oFHTpb5vEIsQ7kNvgHCcG1p&_nc_gid=585c119ba244420fbea5bbf9438ac6fa&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA5Tp0L8OLyhxJ4EEGYIXAYTiurh_ECn5AHZ6dYHbIJPA&oe=6716CD52&_nc_sid=10d13b","😢💔","2991783079812223631","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319106914_5887420254641684_2481488813485698738_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=oFHTpb5vEIsQ7kNvgHCcG1p&_nc_gid=585c119ba244420fbea5bbf9438ac6fa&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA5Tp0L8OLyhxJ4EEGYIXAYTiurh_ECn5AHZ6dYHbIJPA&oe=6716CD52&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319548230_1236612553585060_5026330911779227464_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=0GflxOK48Q8Q7kNvgFCcTSj&_nc_gid=585c119ba244420fbea5bbf9438ac6fa&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBGHNc4VBcnx55eDTLQwWljCUnzUygvRuAwDk5HUoExOQ&oe=6716BCC3&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17943421343371669","0","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/462917587_1562874851283743_5468845318563439526_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=KicqWh3YruYQ7kNvgFgSaZw&_nc_gid=585c119ba244420fbea5bbf9438ac6fa&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBC4j78rE7-o5-6FmH-LEVPVcwPLeAVyWWrUKbk2dkBBQ&oe=6716C2F3&_nc_sid=10d13b","crysty__marie",,,,,,,,"0","😢💔","2023-01-17T15:33:16.000Z","17887641422765874","0","https://scontent-mia3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/14677320_262990717435750_6966043097021022208_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=o6fFeB64sGAQ7kNvgHPG2dB&_nc_gid=585c119ba244420fbea5bbf9438ac6fa&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCPoFx7O9u2F9aOljTBYubCiWAcfpCHDl19qCeYS8wejQ&oe=6716E2C6&_nc_sid=10d13b","fraeuleinpoisel2711",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","😢😢😢","2022-12-28T23:13:29.000Z","18267248446107151","0","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/39877944_957966364390393_8942996279714119680_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=DBZM5dxWSIYQ7kNvgHYsBOE&_nc_gid=585c119ba244420fbea5bbf9438ac6fa&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBYJTwwYVqKNWTMH1aB4T09brOS2onVB74hFvmxxj0ayg&oe=6716DDB5&_nc_sid=10d13b","cecilia_kobel",,,,,,,,"0","🥲🥲","2022-12-16T14:17:27.000Z","18034112212419859","0","https://scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/461452064_1505532856753384_5508239362888260206_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-mia3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=JLSan37c5hsQ7kNvgGlWv2G&_nc_gid=585c119ba244420fbea5bbf9438ac6fa&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC02k5jqYcrYGHHtnnZaTQDrtDnDcmb64vAEzG9rFZdMA&oe=6716C71D&_nc_sid=10d13b","beemer916",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Kids are different today.

"Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","(6/15) “It was a theater guild that saved my life. It was a small guild; twice a year they’d perform musicals at a local community theater. First they brought me on as a magic consultant, but soon they were giving me roles. I fell in love with it. It was a way to keep performing. And the guild gave me a sense of community. One night a big group of us went to see a Broadway show. Tabatha was a friend of a friend. That first night I barely spoke to her. She was way out of my league. Took me three months to finally muster the courage to ask for a date. She was the funniest woman I’ve ever met. Right away she’s making fun of me. Every time we got in the car, she’d say: ‘What’s it going to be this time: ‘Showtunes, Christmas Music, or Billy Joel?’ Tabatha is tough. She does karate. Never once have I seen her cry. But I’m a sentimental guy. I cry at commercials. We’d be out at a movie together, and she’d look over, and she’d say: ‘Are you crying?’ Except she never said ‘crying.’ She’d say ‘cwying.’ With a ‘w.’ It was horrible. We were completely opposite in so many ways. But we both lost our fathers when we were nineteen. And we both loved each other, a lot. More than that. We liked each other, a lot. And we still do. In 2001 we got married. Things were going pretty good for awhile. During the day I was managing a toy store. And at night I was working as an actor off-Broadway. I had a steady role in a show called Tony and Tina’s Wedding. I played Donny Dulce—the wedding band singer. The cast of that show became like my family. One night we’re doing a performance. Audience full of people. I’m in the middle of a scene with Vinny The Caterer. And suddenly he breaks character. He looks right at me, and says: ‘Have you seen my friend Johnny?’ I’m thinking: ‘Oh my God. He just used my real name.’ I’m starting to panic. I’m shaking my head ‘no.’ And he says: ‘Well, if you see my friend Johnny, will you tell him that he’s going to be a Daddy?’ Then I look to my left, and there’s Tabatha, coming down the stairs by the bar.

"Photo by Humans of New York on November 11, 2022.","“One lesbian couple drove up from Philly and I handed it off to them in the car. Not my favorite way to do it, but it works. That baby was born yesterday. And I’ve got another one being induced in six hours. That’ll be my twelfth in two years. Then there’s three more on the way. I’m what they call a ‘known donor.’ It’s a whole community, a whole thing: there’s forums, websites, apps. It’s like a parallel economy. A viable sperm sample is $700—just for a little bit. And the fertility treatments can be thousands. Not everyone can afford it; that’s where I come in. Everything is kinda handshake. I don’t charge the mothers. And they don’t expect any financial support. As for the insemination—there’s different ways of going about it. Some use IVF. But it’s like fish. Fresh is better than frozen. Menstrual cups work well. I’d say 25 to 35 percent of the women I’ve actually had sex with. There wasn’t romance, exactly. A couple times they’d never been with a male before. The last one said: ‘Let’s soldier up, and get it done.’ But not everyone meets my criteria. Some women want it to be anonymous; I don’t want that. I want to be involved. I explain to each one: ‘This child will be born into a larger family. I have eighteen other children.’ I’d like as many as God will give me. Why put your entire bloodline into one child when you can spread it out? Eighteen is a holy number in Judaism. And the next one is thirty-six, so I’ll reassess then. My ultimate goal is to find two or three of the mothers who will be sister wives, because I’m gonna need help with all this. But I know one thing: it will never be boring. It will be fun. I play in a softball league. And I’m hoping twenty years from now, I’ll be able to field an entire team of my kids.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"10458","1080","1080","https://scontent-dub4-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/314106649_683532869797554_8370553804490851250_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-dub4-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=vJpGgwkPow4Q7kNvgHESzQf&_nc_gid=8845f538ccc444abb44f6d49d7a99187&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBATpDmvhzX5Zi94FAjzQ6L_JcJKkuvu96vx6f1apF0zw&oe=6716C230&_nc_sid=10d13b","smh🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️","2969352651394510704",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17981263823424140","2","https://scontent-dub4-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/459542177_3770252869969680_6882656914399094369_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dub4-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=gTq9CG9wwdkQ7kNvgFi_YCo&_nc_gid=8845f538ccc444abb44f6d49d7a99187&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC3218P6A6ITVOozbPIVPcxmbLB2QO9Klu1EPE0DK_ZtA&oe=6716BE2B&_nc_sid=10d13b","farijntjes",,,,,,,,"0","smh🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️","2023-09-23T23:03:56.000Z","17901899501737654","3","https://scontent-dub4-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/19985984_443878472662530_3006367619893690368_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dub4-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=FdxNJqRzUBIQ7kNvgHjuPHx&_nc_gid=8845f538ccc444abb44f6d49d7a99187&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCyQvalrsN2uB9HMMNx05POCFduGrzqIQ_dcGwB7eXpbw&oe=6716E669&_nc_sid=10d13b","yogaloku",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Bull 💩, just saying 😏","2023-06-19T22:45:34.000Z","18030839329502471","7","https://scontent-dub4-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/427446562_1115007356177161_6240320191050737892_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dub4-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=2ar_I47tSSYQ7kNvgGTazw9&_nc_gid=8845f538ccc444abb44f6d49d7a99187&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA-lh7CkWag1GYf85CG4d43GarSTL3WQfSm2RQH1AbTgg&oe=6716DA07&_nc_sid=10d13b","foodhome.co",,,,,,,,"0","This guy sounds like a real sicko.

"Photo by Humans of New York on November 10, 2022. Nenhuma descrição de foto disponível..","“I’m not really someone you call a planner when it comes to writing books. Sometimes there’s just a feeling, like: ‘I know I’ll be able to make something really good about this.’ Right now I’m working on an adventure book called The Adventures of Sloth about a sloth that goes on an adventure. My mom is helping me edit. I get stuck on the editing part because I just want to keep writing; it's like, ugh, can I do it later. I'm quite busy in my everyday life but I’ve written like eight to ten books. My favorite genre is fantasy because so many mythical beings just pop into my head every day. One time, I think in art class, I thought of a mythical being that combined a tiger and a bird and I called it a Terd. A Terd has the features of a tiger like the stripes and the jaw, but also wings. And it can breathe in outer space. Every time I write a story I focus on three elements: suspense, action, and dialogue. And I try to think of a lot of good surprises. Like what if it turns out that the Terd is actually part turtle too, and can breathe underwater? That’s called a plot twist. Dialogue is the hardest because you have to make it seem like a natural conversation that could happen in real life. You can’t just make it blibber blabber like ‘how are you,’ or ‘how was your day,’ or stuff like that. It has to have some juicy parts, like: ‘Did you know there’s a giant Terd on your back?’”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1037","720","1080","https://instagram.frec15-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/315131480_695430851912694_2332155051723542283_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.frec15-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=o9PrD2O3QTMQ7kNvgEBrw2P&_nc_gid=603e0c6994054cf89bbaf60b8a5dea45&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCL20nfBG27avXnW-yHhbmJ15lNEhbJ5GGs95vitF21OA&oe=6716BBB7&_nc_sid=10d13b","@amnotlistenintoyouyourecrazy","2968524407266208136",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17955411890412377","0","https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/44884218_345707102882519_2446069589734326272_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=CWrd8f4xNJwQ7kNvgHEtRAF&_nc_gid=d3bcfebff45944d18a46683d06b0c8de&edm=AAAAAAABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=YW5vbnltb3VzX3Byb2ZpbGVfcGlj.3-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYDNfCDYbRXMrQOpn_Yhx-PhNTvHWLiMM_X6jaFu_6VuwQ&oe=6716D24F&_nc_sid=328259","ruratheexplorer",,,,,,,,"0","@amnotlistenintoyouyourecrazy","2023-05-11T19:40:49.000Z","17972683739265348","0","https://instagram.frec15-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/422749653_896567362009390_241951442092699250_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.frec15-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=Up21n0l1GAkQ7kNvgFRyS5Y&_nc_gid=603e0c6994054cf89bbaf60b8a5dea45&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDn57SNB2tnp7KBEcTo-qgSLWPXO0Hy1HaMINsWfJLUIw&oe=6716ED66&_nc_sid=10d13b","grietcambie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","It’s a Terdle then?","2023-04-20T22:26:31.000Z","17957888480422310","0","https://instagram.frec15-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/380808149_1514888549357168_6376441559564388776_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.frec15-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=qK0ZUtWFOMIQ7kNvgErsgRO&_nc_gid=603e0c6994054cf89bbaf60b8a5dea45&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBE3w8CuBxhzd-C0jHbm_G6pSQiQUTMjWzcUFJHoUpnLA&oe=6716E293&_nc_sid=10d13b","clara_liysa",,,,,,,,"0","🙌","2023-03-12T02:40:52.000Z","18175283557252649","0","https://instagram.frec15-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/445981849_307091055793719_917696138956957498_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.frec15-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=uMho5TfPBgIQ7kNvgFroS_e&_nc_gid=603e0c6994054cf89bbaf60b8a5dea45&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD2j9kAjfvSbUXAaCqIXlD-jSW2Ox-PjRvd0S9GWbk8RQ&oe=6716C605&_nc_sid=10d13b","anne_kelley_three_eees",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Stop it right now!

"Photo by Humans of New York on December 12, 2022.","(1/15) “It’s a magic trick, a dupe. Nothing but an illusion. And it starts the moment you walk in the door. Biggest store in the world. Eight full floors of shopping. And Santaland is at the very top. You can take the elevators. Or you can do what I did when I was a kid, and what I still do today: you take the escalators. Up, up, up. Through make-up. Through linens. Through housewares. Around the third floor, something happens. The escalators change to wood. They’re over one hundred years old, these escalators. From the original Macy’s. When you see them, you know: very soon. You’re about to see Santa. Your heart starts racing. Up, up, up. Until finally you see it: the back of the line. A line like you wouldn’t believe. Real life is happening in that line. Somebody pooped their diaper. Somebody needs to be breastfed. If anyone tries to smuggle in a pet, a white flower will step in. White flowers are managers. But nothing in Santaland is called by its actual name. The line goes past windows featuring scenes from Miracle on 34th Street. Then it spits you out at The North Pole. There’s a little kiosk with an elf. Full-grown adult, but the floor is dug out. So it looks like an elf. They’ll ask you Christmas questions: How many reindeer? How many lords a leaping? Doesn’t matter if you know the answer, because it’s all a mind game. To make you forget how long you’ve been waiting. In the business we call it ‘resetting the clock.’ After the elf you’re into the final maze. Everything covered in snow. Everything lit to the nines: the rainbow bridge, the animatronic penguins, the Lionel train. All of it setting up the final trick. You’ll come to a giant toy soldier made of candy. And that’s when you know you’ve arrived. A final elf will whisper those magic words: ‘Follow me.’ They’re walking backwards. They’re waving their hands. Keep looking at the hands. Don’t look at the other children, following other elves, to other doors. Just follow your elf to your door. Then walk right in. Turn that final corner, and poof. Real life disappears. All the waiting, all the crying, all the pooping, just melts away. And you’re face-to-face with the grandest illusion of all: Me.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2051","720","1080","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/319568745_1213166799409056_5639563204289358048_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=5vfH-GRKAwoQ7kNvgGHpAQz&_nc_gid=142813985a1847e4a81db4b2ec861677&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBpwKT3hK4R2FBOBl4SMmxCDpOFpLwjEOfl9ThQPyi2YA&oe=6716BC7E&_nc_sid=10d13b","@carolecougan @davidcougan","2991667456515912434",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17945801492755782","0","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/91793724_1143194869361688_4535615254192717824_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=soPrATQsyloQ7kNvgHqLw3a&_nc_gid=142813985a1847e4a81db4b2ec861677&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAwJxDf254gnkaYEGemkF5gaIHWO8OAnzauRdfAiwUpYw&oe=6716D92F&_nc_sid=10d13b","queen.kimberly.c",,,,,,,,"0","@carolecougan @davidcougan","2023-12-26T04:00:40.000Z","18007681952285205","0","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/72145775_585499865553029_5395799437240958976_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=znve7gnMFFMQ7kNvgFJIPpf&_nc_gid=142813985a1847e4a81db4b2ec861677&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCMTt0hOl4zAKYxBw_hJMhj4e-LzI-HX8pPtxAknypR7g&oe=6716C14D&_nc_sid=10d13b","attorneylars",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Penguins at the North Pole?","2023-12-17T02:38:26.000Z","18261032605207595","0","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/413875537_691264009813262_4210511986853134125_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=lPAQKQXrv2YQ7kNvgFa9WGQ&_nc_gid=142813985a1847e4a81db4b2ec861677&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDwrSOBmEy7J-TCQ3bYnktX_5xFkBlBcxyngU2g6fobtA&oe=6716BA02&_nc_sid=10d13b","lolabunny__x",,,,,,,,"0","@jouurdyy_","2023-12-15T20:32:47.000Z","17984090987560568","0","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/11809877_1480766678908044_1010380707_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=4tv_CRJha0IQ7kNvgGfgFTI&_nc_gid=142813985a1847e4a81db4b2ec861677&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD3d2xL03ItK9If6mUBj2cTTC1LO316dEklZj9D2KbqDA&oe=6716DD4B&_nc_sid=10d13b","lilsillyhead",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","@comfycozycomrade","2023-12-09T00:03:38.000Z","18011084876083880","0","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/282622214_129485556366534_6559736152929098377_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=46ZXQhkg_AQQ7kNvgHYJ-h4&_nc_gid=142813985a1847e4a81db4b2ec861677&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDU5dA_ExjE53jN2aGblm_3aZ9h-QvohoQ0IAEgZ86X0A&oe=6716EFAF&_nc_sid=10d13b","ella.withlove","0","Haven’t forgotten this story, it’s stayed with me all year long and will continue too for many more.

"Photo by Humans of New York on December 09, 2022.","“I haven’t been seventeen for very long. But I will say, aside from the schoolwork, it’s really a wonderful time. I have the freedom to go wherever I want to go, but not a ton of responsibility. I can walk out of my house with my dog, and go for this walk, and not worry about much more than getting back home. I do need to finish a 650-word personal statement for my college applications. It’s not an easy thing-- to describe yourself in 650 words. I don’t really know who I am yet, though I am growing more comfortable with not knowing. At least that means other people aren’t defining me either. When I look at older people I admire, to be honest, I do define them a bit-- by their careers, and accomplishments. I guess it’s just the easiest way to understand them, because I haven’t experienced much of being older. When you’re seventeen you haven’t done much. But there’s also freedom to that. Because there’s not much to define you by, other than the moment.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2813","720","1080","https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/318682894_156401450437860_7866066627041677844_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=0vcBJ9EYcMgQ7kNvgEbbICX&_nc_gid=eb7a6a2dafe44e38ac230b9dfe951855&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCISHxPxaasFit-magCGoAZOuxsLGN9Nib90DQMdwd6-Q&oe=6716DC31&_nc_sid=10d13b","❤️❤️","2989529085714679607",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17959934945445470","0","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/460770345_499225792962938_2207666425266217579_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=PrqBVsvaSh4Q7kNvgEA-jVf&_nc_gid=eb7a6a2dafe44e38ac230b9dfe951855&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAsZiTtybPdt2VLYnb0AZOllJ6EkC-S_yL19p7ukXFDEQ&oe=6716CB69&_nc_sid=10d13b","oouulala",,,,,,,,"0","❤️❤️","2023-07-01T06:43:20.000Z","17958123590168327","0","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/187733830_320747596113117_5493561591974160373_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=OzfWIFWKXzEQ7kNvgG5YSch&_nc_gid=eb7a6a2dafe44e38ac230b9dfe951855&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAkb_SZIqA7YFZlxzoR6txnhC4ppsUiovA2KheASbKOBA&oe=6716C30D&_nc_sid=10d13b","ferdinand_lbc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","That dog is loving the park.","2023-01-30T13:55:25.000Z","17977615210942888","0","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/14717575_1293267467372781_3282253517007355904_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=fOKVfmtlsxoQ7kNvgEjUCOh&_nc_gid=eb7a6a2dafe44e38ac230b9dfe951855&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCyUBoq6JnnTyJd2bAmuNlTQkahcxMBY20tkE1iWsoPwQ&oe=6716E43E&_nc_sid=10d13b","katrien__dekeyser",,,,,,,,"0","Super nice!!!!!","2023-01-23T02:03:16.000Z","17967277454125316","0","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/443820033_2056892868015781_2978718716605312803_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=KuUjktprjAAQ7kNvgGiRLkx&_nc_gid=eb7a6a2dafe44e38ac230b9dfe951855&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA9_bhzOEC8OkWXz_ASeHSWHz_0APHHBQIO9dOvKZiI8w&oe=6716D81C&_nc_sid=10d13b","taraeriley",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Wisdom!🙌","2023-01-23T01:49:38.000Z","17895082403681044","0","https://scontent-ams4-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/44884218_345707102882519_2446069589734326272_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-ams4-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=CWrd8f4xNJwQ7kNvgHM2hUK&_nc_gid=cb559ba90dff46ec95796207cc2015f9&edm=AAAAAAABAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=YW5vbnltb3VzX3Byb2ZpbGVfcGlj.3-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYAc3JmsTz7plQt-XAjLaGlMArMY_hjXwEugqz7xWItLyQ&oe=6716D24F&_nc_sid=328259","sandra7057thomas","0","Ok","2023-01-18T16:10:17.000Z","18006172423532563","0","https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/395220710_268581805652667_924132963729934652_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=4ktZ0rbXXdQQ7kNvgEVppEB&_nc_gid=eb7a6a2dafe44e38ac230b9dfe951855&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAFLY0kytURbUfKmQko2Eif5Vy7TvBI8u_yfTthrMf2uA&oe=6716B867&_nc_sid=10d13b","bernadette_joukhador_",,,,,,,,"0","So wise ❤️","2023-01-03T11:05:23.000Z","17988512737735072","0","https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/258884050_987825151945692_6536107202669686607_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=VQ5BrJL5OC8Q7kNvgHNzmmX&_nc_gid=eb7a6a2dafe44e38ac230b9dfe951855&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAVCiyd4Kt9MVJn_kv6KCfVM_CucluIIQufx5GTcQsG6w&oe=6716C418&_nc_sid=10d13b","acequepaa04",,,,,,,,"0","This kid is a genius.","2022-12-31T06:56:37.000Z","17894357246735458","1","https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/350718260_275194215068555_5614880327954223319_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=V80gZotchBMQ7kNvgG7gSWi&_nc_gid=eb7a6a2dafe44e38ac230b9dfe951855&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDoNk4-Sq4ixfbOKzIKnatJRTk7s_UuT0pjaM9SKMc_iQ&oe=6716DA56&_nc_sid=10d13b","filipe_gfreitas",,,,,,,,"0","That's the best definition of ""youth"" I have ever heard.

"Photo by Humans of New York on October 25, 2022.","“One of my first days in New York—I went running with a friend in Central Park. I pointed at one of those big apartment buildings on 72nd Street, and said: ‘God, I’d give anything to live there.’ But the devil hears your prayers too. Ten years later I was jogging home to that very same building. I could see the light on in our apartment, and I didn’t want to go inside. I was in a marriage that I didn’t want to be in. A job I didn’t want to be in. I was drinking daily, way too much. I said: ‘God, I’d give up everything if I could just start over and be happy.’ That very night I got in an argument with my husband; and that was the end. When I first applied for this job, I felt like it was beneath me. I was angry at my situation. That first day they tried to send me to pick up trash along the Hudson. I said: ‘No, no, no. Anywhere but there.’ I used to jog along the Hudson; I was afraid some of my old friends would see me. So they sent me to Times Square instead. I worked there for awhile, but one day I got in trouble. And the boss said: ‘It’s the Hudson or nowhere.’ My phone bill was due. I didn’t have a choice. I’ve been here for a couple months now, and I can’t believe how long I was avoiding it. I love the sun. I love plants, I love water. The funny thing is, no matter how many times I used to jog down here, I never really saw it. I’d be so focused on me, or what I was trying to achieve, or the person who was in my path. Now I see the greens and the blues and the yellows. The view is just different when you’re picking up trash.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"893","720","1080","https://scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/312685435_638485094483419_6209821892798256374_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=tD53-8Uk2scQ7kNvgFSq8YJ&_nc_gid=6bcab54f58284c1d9739aaee67115b51&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCCKWsUr9NFfb2807bHAeeP26iPzN96fA7Q_KIt08VzUQ&oe=6716E6AF&_nc_sid=10d13b","I randomly clicked on this picture and wow this caption was exactly what I needed to read/hear.","2957102116301748608",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18004735219736241","0","https://scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/419279344_1225439105371914_953120362782235181_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=TiJ8qQg7x3oQ7kNvgG5TvwX&_nc_gid=6bcab54f58284c1d9739aaee67115b51&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAK2ddTvemdn4SXdhVd1R1rJIv21RlFojzL8TfkcqXY5A&oe=6716CB4E&_nc_sid=10d13b","yooo__e",,,,,,,,"0","I randomly clicked on this picture and wow this caption was exactly what I needed to read/hear.","2023-05-16T22:35:30.000Z","17978116351990834","0","https://scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/447948064_977873073842593_8097690861375560480_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=fxCjRwEozqEQ7kNvgEgCAJe&_nc_gid=6bcab54f58284c1d9739aaee67115b51&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA2Zs4FOa0ipjs693himB0Po8_ocAECjkWO87HWhoG6jQ&oe=6716D8E3&_nc_sid=10d13b","advocate4dreams",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","It’s such a blessing to get a shift in perspective like that","2023-02-18T20:39:15.000Z","17878209815806099","0","https://scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/233760749_513777833036535_5336141878292159673_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=yEqjVw56lpEQ7kNvgFvLan8&_nc_gid=6bcab54f58284c1d9739aaee67115b51&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBmiZqVxqcGrhTqpecxKbUrBU3V3Ar3yc0_B812gdgueQ&oe=6716BD39&_nc_sid=10d13b","kyradk",,,,,,,,"0","❤️","2023-01-27T15:30:07.000Z","17869872410793269","1","https://scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/448442677_869345091688162_8801915998004888042_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=23o25JEBr_oQ7kNvgHT3F-j&_nc_gid=6bcab54f58284c1d9739aaee67115b51&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB9NNkWH-1HQ4-_VJUwNcM9tCn2lzY05mhk1zz_ay4W0w&oe=6716D3B1&_nc_sid=10d13b","bubblesml",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","@c_housto 💙🌱","2023-01-20T14:01:39.000Z","17961589565140736","0","https://scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/14515878_1774307979509437_47146607627468800_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=0M7itxTe5toQ7kNvgHsoA5m&_nc_gid=6bcab54f58284c1d9739aaee67115b51&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBRdwo2emxM3L6FxLoGVp440uwSrKil69dx_fFs2qebWA&oe=6716D12D&_nc_sid=10d13b","aleesphotographylife","0","❤️❤️🙌🙌🙌👏👏","2022-12-12T14:47:49.000Z","17983697704736852","0","https://scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/456696145_1214776309764571_6159364861760852944_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=pzbnQVRFNocQ7kNvgFJZzSq&_nc_gid=6bcab54f58284c1d9739aaee67115b51&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD1nkwuMcqLaEbQVrMTRix1Aop8jxV77Zj-MuLhelTE0A&oe=6716D6C5&_nc_sid=10d13b","thatgirljeje",,,,,,,,"0","Love this story 😢🙌🙌","2022-12-02T19:04:48.000Z","17949516305350527","0","https://scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/462843993_1486181052040147_4709858854839133671_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=NPHaRqqcWfwQ7kNvgF-gZD3&_nc_gid=6bcab54f58284c1d9739aaee67115b51&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBcv5w1Ot4Bx0Q6ZlBhByESr9_QykBVcHkQRYeZbll1bA&oe=6716E208&_nc_sid=10d13b","a_nycgirl",,,,,,,,"0","You're a FAB person which is what NYC is...Fabulous ❤️❤️❤️❤️","2022-11-28T04:11:29.000Z","17968344667956413","0","https://scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/321132279_5783248621760848_2029118006172869442_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=6zEXyK-IUDgQ7kNvgF01Hof&_nc_gid=6bcab54f58284c1d9739aaee67115b51&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC_1Pyhp_VIgUAu4rbHVZfU0Sj1f5rH21qPhYPXsaPG-Q&oe=6716CBFD&_nc_sid=10d13b","jasjagpal.poet",,,,,,,,"0","Amen.

I said: ‘There’s got to be a reason I haven’t met someone, and I’m going to figure it out.’ One of the first things I did was ask my fashionable friends: ‘How do I present to you?’ That’s when I learned my pants were baggy in the butt. That doesn’t seem like a huge deal. But first impressions matter. And if you present as the ‘baggy butt guy,’ that’s who you’re gonna be: the baggy butt guy. So I got some better-fitting pants. I never used to care about stuff like that. I thought: I’m a good person, that’s what matters most. And if someone hangs around long enough, they’ll figure that out. But nobody hung around long enough. And that sort of thinking made it easy to become a single guy in his late forties. So I owned it. I worked on making it easier for people to know me; so that it was more of a downstream experience. I practiced being chit chatty. I started saying hello to people more, looking them in the eye, asking: ‘How was your weekend?’ I went on a dozen or so first dates. I even kept an excel sheet; trying to figure out if there was a through line-- when things didn’t work out: how long before I followed up, how many days between the first and second date, things like that. The excel sheet was a little much, I’ll admit. And it turned out to not be necessary. I ended up meeting my girlfriend at a catering gig we worked together. And she had no problem swimming upstream. I guess I made a good impression. Because later she told me that the moment she saw me, she was sneaking pictures to her sister—saying that she’d met her future boyfriend. Last Friday we had a legit conversation. We said: ‘OK, we’re no longer saying we’re dating. We’re in a relationship.’ I’m trying to teach myself guitar at the moment. Because I’d love to have kids one day, I’m working toward that. And when that happens, I’d love to have some hobbies we can do together.”","Photo by Humans of New York on November 08, 2022.

"Photo by Humans of New York on October 18, 2022.","“I call it God’s Gift; it’s priceless. 1981 Oldsmobile Cutlass, right? I got a great deal on it. And I knew it matched my vibe. In the beginning it was all about the exterior. Visual stuff, you know what I mean: add-ons, and new rims, and new tires with fresh white walls. But I ended up losing my first engine. Because I never paid much attention to things like maintenance, and oil changes. How clean it should be on the inside. When they lifted the old engine out of the car, I remember thinking: it looks just like a mechanical heart. It made me think about the food I was eating. There were never many healthy choices in my community. It was McDonald’s every day after school. Either that or corner store food: powdered donuts, sunflower seeds, bag of chips. I grew up on that, heavily. Those are low vibrational foods. And I think they were responsible for a lot of my most negative behaviors. Right now I’m in transition to a plant-based diet. And I definitely try to stay away from anything man-made. People in my community see me in the street, just by my panache, my verve. They notice it. And they want to know: what can they do to obtain it? I tell them the truth: the diet. Then I invite them to stop by my place for a juice. I make it every morning in the kitchen. All my ingredients come from a local market in Yonkers. I choose rare, exotic fruits: things that can be out of reach: passion fruit, dragon fruit, sour sop, purple carrots, golden beets. My specialty is sea moss. Sea moss has 92 out of the 100 minerals that your body needs. And I mix it right. A lot of this stuff is new to the people in my community. But I can tell you right now—never had anyone yet, make a funny face about one of my drinks.”","Photo by Humans of New York on October 18, 2022.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311803564_441128298155121_406517345799284651_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=TdBd_fwMG9AQ7kNvgHfcaip&_nc_gid=033ab9f1ebf0497db9b9c1743f8ad0c5&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBTfJomnEbbMOeau-j0UBoYfnzFd6Mtvq89ACvxgIuanw&oe=6716DDD4&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2952018214541821729",,,"Cj3rOz4P4ch",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cj3rOz4P4ch/","Photo by Humans of New York on October 18, 2022.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311919672_204778025343264_3658966705602954656_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=gHSGONV-FGIQ7kNvgHfHkPI&_nc_gid=033ab9f1ebf0497db9b9c1743f8ad0c5&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDjGMgRT3vtc1alztZKAJFlFaIanYjt1NPiBS6JfcQqXg&oe=6716C14F&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2952018214659215176",,,"Cj3rOz_Ps9I",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cj3rOz_Ps9I/",,,,"Photo by Humans of New York on October 18, 2022.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311920451_645850257173729_1494289641459551331_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=DL4USmN4XIUQ7kNvgG9Pr9w&_nc_gid=033ab9f1ebf0497db9b9c1743f8ad0c5&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDwblPRwd5Jt3eHG0XXSYeGTCMDxpwNB2grC7TkWaSawA&oe=6716EF12&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2952018214541648423",,,"Cj3rOz4POIn",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cj3rOz4POIn/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1174","720","1080","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311803564_441128298155121_406517345799284651_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=TdBd_fwMG9AQ7kNvgHfcaip&_nc_gid=033ab9f1ebf0497db9b9c1743f8ad0c5&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBTfJomnEbbMOeau-j0UBoYfnzFd6Mtvq89ACvxgIuanw&oe=6716DDD4&_nc_sid=10d13b","🔥🔥🔥","2952018218635330869","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311803564_441128298155121_406517345799284651_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=TdBd_fwMG9AQ7kNvgHfcaip&_nc_gid=033ab9f1ebf0497db9b9c1743f8ad0c5&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBTfJomnEbbMOeau-j0UBoYfnzFd6Mtvq89ACvxgIuanw&oe=6716DDD4&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311919672_204778025343264_3658966705602954656_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=gHSGONV-FGIQ7kNvgHfHkPI&_nc_gid=033ab9f1ebf0497db9b9c1743f8ad0c5&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDjGMgRT3vtc1alztZKAJFlFaIanYjt1NPiBS6JfcQqXg&oe=6716C14F&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311920451_645850257173729_1494289641459551331_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=DL4USmN4XIUQ7kNvgG9Pr9w&_nc_gid=033ab9f1ebf0497db9b9c1743f8ad0c5&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDwblPRwd5Jt3eHG0XXSYeGTCMDxpwNB2grC7TkWaSawA&oe=6716EF12&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17945487152522016","1","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/314929595_791081298629252_2403940247309903482_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=K04Oc2t_5-UQ7kNvgFRQNpO&_nc_gid=033ab9f1ebf0497db9b9c1743f8ad0c5&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBvb45MSdx0zHlZDsbzrGz3i2qg6gMILPdbkTxJQNbeUA&oe=6716DF38&_nc_sid=10d13b","skeezestudios",,,,,,,,"0","🔥🔥🔥","2023-06-14T17:33:26.000Z","17977737998471210","1","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/314929595_791081298629252_2403940247309903482_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=K04Oc2t_5-UQ7kNvgFRQNpO&_nc_gid=033ab9f1ebf0497db9b9c1743f8ad0c5&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBvb45MSdx0zHlZDsbzrGz3i2qg6gMILPdbkTxJQNbeUA&oe=6716DF38&_nc_sid=10d13b","skeezestudios",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Thank you!!!

"Photo by Humans of New York on November 14, 2022.","“She could be mean. But I don’t think it was malicious. A lot of it came down to insecurity. Anytime I was happy outside of our world, it made her uncomfortable. Both of us were actors. And if she ever needed to travel for work; we’d be fine. More than fine. I’d be happy for her. But whenever I got an out-of-town gig; it was always a problem. Some of my friendships made her uncomfortable: women, always. But also friends I’d known for a long time. Any time she detected an intimacy that she wasn’t a part of—she’d feel threatened. So I withdrew from a lot of my friendships. It just wasn’t worth the risk of setting her off. I became a caretaker. Everything flowed one way: keeping her away from negative thoughts, and negative places. I felt sympathy for her. I thought: ‘She can’t help her insecurities. Why should I punish her for them?’ So I committed myself to making it work. Everything made so much sense on paper. We moved into a nice apartment, and got a dog. I had a great relationship with her parents. It was hard to let go of all that. But mostly I just didn’t realize I could be truly happy if I did the brave thing. Right before the pandemic I got a gig in Germany. I spent most of my free time in the hotel room, waiting for her to wake up in New York, because if she ever called and I was doing something, she’d be super upset. On the last week she came to visit. One night she got drunk and jealous. And the next morning I caught her looking through my phone. After six years-- after all the counseling-- we were back at square one. Worse than square one, because the wedding was coming. It wasn’t the end. But it was the beginning of the end, because I finally started to confide in people. I remember one of my friends telling me: ‘You deserve to be happy.’ Such a simple idea, but I needed to hear it. Now I have a new fiancée. And it’s a completely different feeling. When I used to envision a future with my ex, everything was so vague. It was so detached from the present. It all had to be so different from the way things were. But with my current fiancé—it’s a straight line. Nobody has to change who they are. It’s just building on what’s already there.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1116","720","1080","https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/315564878_5678059035604596_310543333991103371_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=YPBQOSQB544Q7kNvgEgOWMj&_nc_gid=7a387a3bdb934c6e96927971f19a1619&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDgdNeQGABhBNoFBjAyFNOx32cZ9gghnqZtP5gEHOTzlQ&oe=6716E57B&_nc_sid=10d13b","❤️❤️❤️❤️","2971499619646236422",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17863477907869355","0","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/458391609_476473832015464_5916393656124856324_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=O33VhF-ANxgQ7kNvgHV22C-&_nc_gid=7a387a3bdb934c6e96927971f19a1619&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYARfzQcl6TUokSgixCrzZMMi0Bn48oiuhrip-EOZ30CZw&oe=6716E3CD&_nc_sid=10d13b","umagamedze",,,,,,,,"0","❤️❤️❤️❤️","2023-02-11T05:03:52.000Z","17978633851838292","3","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/463222537_1080246387136319_4421122577046936040_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=x66645jIV4gQ7kNvgFtUSQC&_nc_gid=7a387a3bdb934c6e96927971f19a1619&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAHG9Nb8kLr0tnynOgOI95Q_bMGlz75V2UqdBsmgvKvIQ&oe=6716EA01&_nc_sid=10d13b","katagoodbadloose",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","You can't do the work for people, she needed to do the work herself.

"Photo by Humans of New York on November 17, 2022.","“I knew if they ever found out about me, I’d end up like Johnny Yablonsky. Johnny was soft, he was feminine, he was clearly gay. The neighborhood guys would make him blow them; then beat the shit out of him. He always had a lot of bruises, and absenteeism. He was so defeated. I’ve always assumed he killed himself. And I didn’t want the same thing to happen to me. It was a lot of fear, and shame. The fucking shame. I participated in my own self-negation. I laughed at all the jokes. I tried to tighten up on the masculine stuff. I’d stand in front of the mirror. I’d practice my walk, my diction, the movement of my hands. Somehow I managed to make it out of that town alive. During our first Christmas break at college, I went with my friend Howie to visit his family in Long Island. Afterward he dropped me off at the airport. He thought I was flying home. But I caught the Greyhound Bus to New York City. I put all my stuff in a luggage locker and started walking down 5th Avenue. It was night. It wasn’t lit up like today. All the storefronts were dark; it was like lyric poetry to me. Unopened boxes full of mystery. All I knew was I had to get to Greenwich Village. I kept asking people—is this The Village, is this The Village? They kept saying: further south, further south. Finally I get to the corner of 8th Street and 6th Avenue, and I’m waiting for the light to change. And this guy starts hitting on me. A few years older than me, good looking. His name was Charlie. And he put a spell on me immediately. From the very first moment, I had a hard-on for Charlie Bacchus. I felt safe with him. He took me to my first gay bar. Then afterward we went to his mom’s loft apartment on Washington Square. She happened to be in Rome. So it was just me and Charlie Bacchus, in this gorgeous apartment, with the door closed, cut off from the rest of the world. There was sex, beautiful sex. First time I’d ever had sex with my shoes off. The next morning I came out of the shower, and wrapped a towel around me. Charlie said: ‘What are you doing? Take that off.

Everyone would be by the ring in their macrame hot pants and gold belts. I was inspired. I took a pair of pants and cut them so fucking short my pockets were coming out the bottom. Then I put on a baby blue ribbed lycra sweater. I was all of maybe nine years old, but I felt like the world was mine. I strutted over to my best friend’s house, and rang the doorbell. I said: ‘Is Brad home?’ His mom took one look at me and said: ‘Oh no, baby.

Middle of the night, wife asleep in the bed, I bend over to pick something up, and he bites me right on the ass. He’s very dangerous if he doesn’t get his way. If you aren’t accommodating his wishes, he can screech you right into the ground. He won’t go in his cage. Our entire apartment is filled with driftwood from the Hudson. He likes to sit on the driftwood when he watches TV. He’ll take food off our plates. If anyone is talking, he has to be there. He wants to be part of everything. And the worst part is they won’t die. They live to be 80 or 100. You know the saying: ‘This too shall pass’? Not the umbrella cockatoo. This too, shall not pass. There’s no hope. That’s the horror of it. I told this to a nine-year old girl in the park. This girl was a genius. She says: ‘You’ll never have to say goodbye.

"Photo by Humans of New York on October 06, 2022.","If you haven’t heard Steph read the audio version of ‘Tanqueray,’ you’re missing out. At first the audio department was leaning toward hiring a voice actress. But they invited Steph into the studio for a test read—just in case. Five minutes later everyone in the sound booth was high fiving each other. How quickly they’d forgotten that our heroine is an elite performer across all mediums. Her voice adds a punch of hilarity to the funny stories, and the ending especially gets quite emotional. Both the book and audiobook have a ‘5-star’ review rating, but many reviewers say the audio version is their favorite. It makes sense, as the book often reads like an oral history. One reviewer writes: ‘It’s like having the most interesting person at the party, all to yourself.’ ‘Tanqueray’ is available on Audible, and wherever audiobooks are sold.","Photo by Humans of New York on October 06, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/310571014_207120388324686_584167298786921446_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=A5rvjS67VmwQ7kNvgHGTU8F&_nc_gid=091bea0bd073456aa7c1d78e5769394e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCh0WDeU3JE68rVTmfsDli3_iHYycZJjBDHDqBI9nc2OA&oe=6716E21F&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2943227686647625717",,,"CjYcfyzuff1",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CjYcfyzuff1/","Photo by Humans of New York on October 06, 2022.","","0","750","750","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/310971723_6062415193790195_5941879724972205149_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=cBv6qFwmfnoQ7kNvgEK_RCE&_nc_gid=091bea0bd073456aa7c1d78e5769394e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC58SYUTYljsnfTWOJ2I8TiowxgpETlqruSjkJM9Z2JXw&oe=6716CAE5&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2943227686681141190",,,"CjYcfy1uV_G",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CjYcfy1uV_G/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"51684","1080","1080","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/310571014_207120388324686_584167298786921446_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=A5rvjS67VmwQ7kNvgHGTU8F&_nc_gid=091bea0bd073456aa7c1d78e5769394e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCh0WDeU3JE68rVTmfsDli3_iHYycZJjBDHDqBI9nc2OA&oe=6716E21F&_nc_sid=10d13b","Tanqueray is famous in Prague! 😉","2943227692016280365","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/310571014_207120388324686_584167298786921446_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=A5rvjS67VmwQ7kNvgHGTU8F&_nc_gid=091bea0bd073456aa7c1d78e5769394e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCh0WDeU3JE68rVTmfsDli3_iHYycZJjBDHDqBI9nc2OA&oe=6716E21F&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/310971723_6062415193790195_5941879724972205149_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=cBv6qFwmfnoQ7kNvgEK_RCE&_nc_gid=091bea0bd073456aa7c1d78e5769394e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC58SYUTYljsnfTWOJ2I8TiowxgpETlqruSjkJM9Z2JXw&oe=6716CAE5&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18062162761546317","0","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/379840047_823654809495867_1592933433191651466_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=U4UBJPl-iY8Q7kNvgG-YHfx&_nc_gid=091bea0bd073456aa7c1d78e5769394e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCaSys2Ek2GtTYMYJdLxywlhH1iBKEZNaKnjDnMyJvu4w&oe=6716E237&_nc_sid=10d13b","kristaematkinson",,,,,,,,"0","Tanqueray is famous in Prague! 😉","2024-07-19T19:49:36.000Z","18013455743210849","2","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/119431963_4542527205822275_1574414472372272047_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=wfGPBsWLzSgQ7kNvgG7JQks&_nc_gid=091bea0bd073456aa7c1d78e5769394e&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCiuQuNaWgvXhOyz5VIQHp9_okj3Oqvo3Yf2uRU21uZmQ&oe=6716E4CB&_nc_sid=10d13b","angelaivette_",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","How is she?

"Photo by Humans of New York on October 17, 2022.","“He tried to be a life coach. One time he brought a green screen into our apartment, and filmed a video advertisement. I could hear him saying: ‘Do you want to change your life? Do you want to make better decisions?’ I remember thinking how funny that was; him wanting to be responsible for other people’s lives. Because he could never take responsibility for his own. There were times he would break things, because of his anger. He’d punch doors, or throw things across the room. But even when he apologized, he’d shift the blame on us—for making him so angry. I was the oldest sibling, and there always seemed to be a special anger reserved for me. I could never explain it. Then one day he sat me down. He said: ‘I have to talk to you about the way I used to behave.’ He used the words: ‘used to behave.’ Even though it was the way he still behaved. He said: ‘You have to understand: your birth wasn’t planned. We weren’t ready. And after you were born, that’s when things got difficult.’ I guess he'd figured that out in therapy. But I have no idea what therapist told him to have that conversation with an eleven-year-old. After that day I felt guilty for even existing. Part of me feels sorry for him. He’s pushed everyone away. He separated from my mom a few years ago. Even my youngest sister doesn’t talk to him anymore. When I turned twenty-one he kept sending me texts, asking to meet up for my birthday. I ignored him at first. But finally I agreed to meet, because part of me wanted to see what he was going to say. We met at a coffee shop. He said: ‘I’ve been reflecting a lot. And I finally understand that it was never your fault. It was your mother. I think she got pregnant on purpose, because she wanted to keep me.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1519","720","1080","https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311803567_677253790280303_629446074000046469_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=c2cxR8eqU6IQ7kNvgEiKzTf&_nc_gid=f7b5736d160c4617965412f359520fe6&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCDwSzfaVeuHrlKX04uutsqVzj4M-kzucoDGgRLsxeSaQ&oe=6716E951&_nc_sid=10d13b","Elite narcissism","2951282601810743175",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18000441919818274","7","https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/450131135_1001255154511469_565739040558489126_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=QnEIaQSyD6UQ7kNvgFMTtaw&_nc_gid=f7b5736d160c4617965412f359520fe6&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCJmldXd3St6VbBKCxKF-drqjsLxjjP9M0VSlrkrUt0yg&oe=6716D21C&_nc_sid=10d13b","revagoswami",,,,,,,,"0","Elite narcissism","2023-05-05T19:01:38.000Z","17896388741785836","4","https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/11379279_877906052289574_2077614414_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=f7FuPSpZlboQ7kNvgFwQU1E&_nc_gid=f7b5736d160c4617965412f359520fe6&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA9NcObHNbH619IifJgyY2_H3P2zKgNgzJb9IZ6s6Dkgg&oe=6716E784&_nc_sid=10d13b","valeen54",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","WOW!

"Photo by Humans of New York on October 10, 2022.","“It was the end of a sixteen-year marriage. I’d just turned 50. I wasn’t young anymore. And I knew what it was like to be single in New York; I didn’t feel equipped to do it again. We started the divorce process a week before the pandemic hit. None of my usual coping mechanisms were available. I couldn’t get a drink with friends, or go to the gym, or go for a run. I was just doing my best to white knuckle through. I’m part of a Facebook Group called ‘Hoo’s Getting Fit,’ for Black UVA Alumni. Normally we post our fitness goals and achievements. But during COVID it became much more about emotional support. It was Bryon that had the idea to do a zoom happy hour after work. I knew him a little. We’d met once during college, at a frat party. We actually still have the photos from that night. His happy hour was well attended. And since we all had this shared college experience, things got intimate pretty quickly. People were sharing personal things: my parents are ill, my child is immunocompromised--- my marriage is falling apart. Bryon sent me a personal message after I shared my story. He said: ‘I also know what that’s like, when you think you can love enough for the two of you.’ He was much further along in his divorce process, so our first few phone calls were a lot of me dumping my shit on him. He started checking in on me. We spoke every day, then multiple times a day. He was pretty open from the beginning: ‘I can’t believe anyone would ever leave you. I really want to take you to dinner.’ After nine months he drove up from DC. He’d always had a full beard in our video calls. But he showed up clean shaven. The restaurants had just begun to reopen, so we ate outside at an Italian restaurant. I took a photo of the way he was looking at me. After dinner we took a walk through the West Village. It was a warm summer night. I was wearing a sun dress. He made me feel so feminine. He held my hand. He got me flowers. He walked on the outside of the sidewalk, which I hadn’t seen since my father. It all made me feel so beautiful, and desired, and young again. I felt courted. That’s it. I’d forgotten how that felt: to be courted.”","Photo by Humans of New York on October 10, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/310964611_1586786961785196_4858371775395823855_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=SCOt2vAM79kQ7kNvgE6JZ_X&_nc_gid=2392c2655bc94cdbb57a7ed26403c9ec&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAzh79U0U8i4eStUobETykAp-yUE5dkk6kcDiqmEmgICg&oe=6716C456&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2946074222007183209",,,"CjijuVcrGdp",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CjijuVcrGdp/","Photo by Humans of New York on October 10, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311377651_135006462614899_208615296057165203_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=Ho1CIPpNMzoQ7kNvgFcUHUX&_nc_gid=2392c2655bc94cdbb57a7ed26403c9ec&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB-Dd8eAQvFKD2GdEkfB_7uxf6jNHhE5O5mLnFe9goMkA&oe=6716E668&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2946074221998867822",,,"CjijuVcLYVu",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CjijuVcLYVu/",,,,"Photo by Humans of New York on October 10, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311124873_2446298052176938_1750849086614328746_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=6cLUG_fnTvkQ7kNvgGU-d1f&_nc_gid=2392c2655bc94cdbb57a7ed26403c9ec&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAOXD9yMynB_R9Xo4hyc0bEjVpi3hnlAwzX7jpkSqDDAQ&oe=6716C913&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2946074221965452161",,,"CjijuVaL6OB",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CjijuVaL6OB/",,,,"Photo by Humans of New York on October 10, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311172567_1227541041426102_3086967541228005624_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=y-I50L3L3A0Q7kNvgEZkCwB&_nc_gid=2392c2655bc94cdbb57a7ed26403c9ec&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCSgOSQ8U75t96NWXX1jkoIGANONgukBhZy2gIQWQmrDQ&oe=6716C1C0&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2946074221998919685",,,"CjijuVcLlAF",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CjijuVcLlAF/","Photo by Humans of New York on October 10, 2022.","","0","1080","1080","https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311132002_514330690508327_2947763364273312067_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=TjDXQf7gT2wQ7kNvgG3OkrG&_nc_gid=2392c2655bc94cdbb57a7ed26403c9ec&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC8euGUi5H7NVANtBUe0RVm7HGi3udXbCMxfVJlMHR-Dg&oe=6716DF79&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2946074222401542886",,,"CjijuV0Ldrm",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CjijuV0Ldrm/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3860","1080","1080","https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/310964611_1586786961785196_4858371775395823855_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=SCOt2vAM79kQ7kNvgE6JZ_X&_nc_gid=2392c2655bc94cdbb57a7ed26403c9ec&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAzh79U0U8i4eStUobETykAp-yUE5dkk6kcDiqmEmgICg&oe=6716C456&_nc_sid=10d13b","UPDATE: he popped the question at the place where we met as teenagers, on the Lawn at UVA!!

"Photo by Humans of New York on October 13, 2022.","“I was visiting a friend in New York. By then I was like bones; I was using all the time. And at some point she finally told me to leave. It was 5 AM. I had nothing but a hoodie, and it was negative degrees. In one hand was a bottle with 45 pills of Xanax. In the other was my cell phone-- with my Mom’s contact open. It was either make the call or take the drugs. That’s when I got my higher power push. My friend came outside to see why I was still standing in front of her building. I said: ‘I’m talking to my Mom,’ and I quickly tapped the ‘call button.’ When she picked up the phone I broke down. I told her that she was right, and that I’d been using this whole time. I apologized for everything. She told me: ‘It’s ok, I just want to get you help.’ She bought me a flight home to California. It was five days of detox then straight to rehab. It’ll be nine months sober on Sunday. In a lot of ways I feel like a child again. I started using when I was twelve, so there’s a lot I never learned about being a person. I’m learning how to talk to people. I’m learning how to be bored. I’m going back to school; I never thought I’d be back in school again. My sister used to say that it never felt like she had a brother. But we’re closer now. That’s something to be proud of, for sure. Same thing with my parents. I used to never call my Mom. Or if I did, it was something negative: I need something, or I want something. Now I’ll just call her to see what she has going on. She tells me about her interior design stuff, or maybe a house that she’s trying to sell. I enjoy hearing about that stuff. My relationships feel real now. For the longest time, I wasn’t even a person. There was no Jake Black; it was just drugs. Now I’m actually a person. And that’s a big motivation to keep going to my meetings, and to keep picking up my phone. Because if I relapse now, it’s going to hurt everyone who’s gotten to know this side of me.”","Photo by Humans of New York on October 13, 2022.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311445368_1126580884665129_3396858893545038033_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=PSMAJ8ba79cQ7kNvgHn1N65&_nc_gid=137f2ced6ed24f06a19b0685b6ecd74f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC6dtur2A5Ac9ugISR1ay_rX1L9Ji7ZzhcCggZ3V2m0Bg&oe=6716D6DB&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2948460646329827515",,,"CjrCVYStUC7",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CjrCVYStUC7/","Photo by Humans of New York on October 13, 2022.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311435340_819522955857699_2724428912162991278_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=m3RB7IKT3xIQ7kNvgH3iim5&_nc_gid=137f2ced6ed24f06a19b0685b6ecd74f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDW6XqGATWdJifsMXnXuxi23yu-C7pKbfTbD_4JfYTPzg&oe=6716DFC9&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2948460646514550004",,,"CjrCVYdt-T0",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CjrCVYdt-T0/",,,,"Photo by Humans of New York on October 13, 2022.","","0","721","1080","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311439451_816702749381513_6504992950163153120_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=9j3XLuAF5yEQ7kNvgHKXnja&_nc_gid=137f2ced6ed24f06a19b0685b6ecd74f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC-WvTqA2ClLS6gnN9AYdIpc0WvOONA9CzgdAXaWy-zlQ&oe=6716DB7A&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2948460646346782181",,,"CjrCVYTt_Xl",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CjrCVYTt_Xl/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3480","720","1080","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311445368_1126580884665129_3396858893545038033_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=PSMAJ8ba79cQ7kNvgHn1N65&_nc_gid=137f2ced6ed24f06a19b0685b6ecd74f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC6dtur2A5Ac9ugISR1ay_rX1L9Ji7ZzhcCggZ3V2m0Bg&oe=6716D6DB&_nc_sid=10d13b","👍🏻👍🏻","2948460651656636839","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311445368_1126580884665129_3396858893545038033_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=PSMAJ8ba79cQ7kNvgHn1N65&_nc_gid=137f2ced6ed24f06a19b0685b6ecd74f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC6dtur2A5Ac9ugISR1ay_rX1L9Ji7ZzhcCggZ3V2m0Bg&oe=6716D6DB&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311435340_819522955857699_2724428912162991278_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=m3RB7IKT3xIQ7kNvgH3iim5&_nc_gid=137f2ced6ed24f06a19b0685b6ecd74f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDW6XqGATWdJifsMXnXuxi23yu-C7pKbfTbD_4JfYTPzg&oe=6716DFC9&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/311439451_816702749381513_6504992950163153120_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=9j3XLuAF5yEQ7kNvgHKXnja&_nc_gid=137f2ced6ed24f06a19b0685b6ecd74f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC-WvTqA2ClLS6gnN9AYdIpc0WvOONA9CzgdAXaWy-zlQ&oe=6716DB7A&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","17987223887373612","0","https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/277698408_569941907360123_3969926893348946129_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=hkraZBdF9ZoQ7kNvgEXTTNV&_nc_gid=137f2ced6ed24f06a19b0685b6ecd74f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDI2AQwqtbur0AyEhpslbVTqIdjLLuC-kngxJ8vV_zccA&oe=6716CD54&_nc_sid=10d13b","natadi90",,,,,,,,"0","👍🏻👍🏻","2023-09-18T22:05:09.000Z","17946907388630444","0","https://scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/461452288_998356798711801_8912489765990153518_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=rFrxeoITQEgQ7kNvgHd2wdF&_nc_gid=137f2ced6ed24f06a19b0685b6ecd74f&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYD7TIxa4EnkEU-fSLIp3r9F2DRgvk1gRBqpWxHG6SLR5Q&oe=6716DE67&_nc_sid=10d13b","steph.stellar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Proud of you!

There’s a woman in the grocery store, at the checkout stand, that I see once a month. She’s very nice and very kind. I always look forward to seeing her. We’ll have a two, or three minute conversation. That’s probably the person I talk to the most. I’m retired, and I live alone.  I read somewhere that the average lifespan of a New Yorker is 75. And I’m 74. So I’m constantly hearing the ‘tick, tick, tick.’ At home I have this whole movie memorabilia collection on my walls. Posters from the forties: Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Judy Garland. All the female actresses that appealed to the gay men of my time. Who is there to give it to? I’d hate for somebody to just throw it away when I’m gone. I probably shouldn’t care, but I do care. It’s little things like that. Little things that creep into my head about death, and dying, and what’s going to happen. Tick, tick, tick. But when I’m out on the street with my camera, I get away from all that. I get away from myself. It all becomes about observance. And I find that it’s much easier to be alone when I’m among people. The distance makes it comfortable for me. I find it’s easier to relate to people when it’s not intimate. Normally I’ll choose solitary people to photograph. Sometimes I’ll approach them. But more times than not, I’ll shoot uninvited. But even when I don’t ask permission—I feel closer to that person. When I get a photo that I really like, I’ll post it to my Flickr account. Every once in awhile people will leave a comment. And that’s icing on the cake. That also feels like a connection in some way. And I need that. I need a connection of some sort for me to feel human. For me to not feel like I’m just in my own head all the time. For me to feel like I’m somehow part of the world.”","Photo by Humans of New York on October 03, 2022.

"Photo by Humans of New York on October 03, 2022.","Iran is the first country outside the US where I ever collected interviews. I remember how nervous I was. This was over ten years ago. There hadn’t been a nuclear deal yet. I didn’t have a ‘fixer.’ I hadn’t even been working long enough to know what a ‘fixer’ was. I’d been assigned a full-time personal tour guide—a requirement for all Americans. He’d prepared a packed itinerary of museums and historical sites for us to visit. I still remember his surprise when I said: ‘Actually, I just want to stop random people on the street.’ But miraculously he agreed to the pivot. And over the next ten days we approached well over one hundred people. I’d spent so much time worrying that no Iranian would want to speak to an American with a camera. But of the hundred people I approached—only three refused my request. That’s the first thing you notice: the hospitality. The average Iranian is so welcoming: please come in and eat, please sit and have tea. It’s why I returned for a second time in 2016. There’s an openness there. A long history of humanism, art, and scientific discovery; it’s baked deep in the culture. But that openness is suppressed by an empowered minority. Iran is not a country that looks or sounds like its leaders. It’s much more youthful. Much more liberal. And it’s much, much more female. The current protests are being led by young women, of course. Because they’re living under laws created by old religious men. At the end of my first trip, I was getting frantic emails from well-meaning people, warning me to leave. Hardline journalists had begun calling for me to be stopped, from the unspeakable sin—of photographing Iranian women. It can be difficult to know exactly what is happening in Iran right now. We know the government is struggling to crack down on the largest protests they’ve ever seen. We know that many young women have been killed. It can be hard to know how to help. But in a letter to The Times this weekend, A. Maziar Zafari said the protestors need support from ‘all artists in open and democratic societies.’ So I’d like to say, especially to the young women risking the most: we see you, we hear you, and you continue to inspire us.","Photo by Humans of New York on October 03,

But they’re vocal. Yes, the grumps are vocal. They have unresolved things, maybe from their childhood. They’re not disconnected from God. But they’re wrestling with him. Not a bad thing, mind you. Not a bad thing. But I want to hang out with people who enjoy life. At home I have a sunshine file; it’s just a plastic box. Inside are all the letters people have written me over the years: teenagers in the youth group, widows who lost their husbands. People who I was able to make a difference in their life. For two years I was chaplain on the children’s ward of the cancer hospital. What can you say? You can’t explain why some things happen. Only that it’s a mystery. And a mystery is reality, imbued with God’s presence. One Christmastime there was a ten-year old girl from Ireland, dying of leukemia. All this girl wanted was a Cabbage Patch Doll. Ugliest doll you’ve ever seen in your life, seventy-five dollars. Seventy-five dollars! And sold out everywhere. The mother told me:’ I’ve looked in every store.’ That same day a family from my parish asked what I wanted for Christmas. I say: one Cabbage Patch Doll, and two walkie talkies. They said: ‘Father, are you sure?’ I told them: ‘Yes I’m sure. I was a kid once too!’ The Cabbage Patch Doll went to the little girl. Then I gave one walkie-talkie to her, and one to her twin brother. So they could speak while she was in isolation. After she passed away the mother wrote me a letter. I keep it in my sunshine file. It said: ‘Those walkie-talkies were the best medicine she ever had.’”","Photo by Humans of New York on October 05, 2022.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/310457609_660635532072854_3513199842168642030_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=KYltbvHuB94Q7kNvgEl6yJy&_nc_gid=464d3bd93d2443f5bb8f3fd9b71b47ad&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYClYfOQmM8Fw9A4SGTuIF-_7hrDWpmTVSDBQXdpu4rnLA&oe=6716DCBA&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2942367829992215214",,,"CjVY_O5ORKu",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CjVY_O5ORKu/","Photo by Humans of New York on October 05, 2022.","","0","720","1080","https://scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/310812810_396654972499201_2260333925410289458_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=T288EWziFwkQ7kNvgFRKt-o&_nc_gid=464d3bd93d2443f5bb8f3fd9b71b47ad&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAC8pU7-405nKL3bSIpnsF2E2KpJnSiOEno70s0mtlCPA&oe=6716C89E&_nc_sid=10d13b","","2942367830218881838",,,"CjVY_PGu7su",,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CjVY_PGu7su/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1384","720","1080","https://scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/310457609_660635532072854_3513199842168642030_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=KYltbvHuB94Q7kNvgEl6yJy&_nc_gid=464d3bd93d2443f5bb8f3fd9b71b47ad&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYClYfOQmM8Fw9A4SGTuIF-_7hrDWpmTVSDBQXdpu4rnLA&oe=6716DCBA&_nc_sid=10d13b","RIP Father Holt","2942367838817160533","https://scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/310457609_660635532072854_3513199842168642030_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=KYltbvHuB94Q7kNvgEl6yJy&_nc_gid=464d3bd93d2443f5bb8f3fd9b71b47ad&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYClYfOQmM8Fw9A4SGTuIF-_7hrDWpmTVSDBQXdpu4rnLA&oe=6716DCBA&_nc_sid=10d13b","https://scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/310812810_396654972499201_2260333925410289458_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=T288EWziFwkQ7kNvgFRKt-o&_nc_gid=464d3bd93d2443f5bb8f3fd9b71b47ad&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYAC8pU7-405nKL3bSIpnsF2E2KpJnSiOEno70s0mtlCPA&oe=6716C89E&_nc_sid=10d13b",,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18275207680199355","2","https://scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/15035057_558114937711236_4313590974275125248_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=cYsFEuDlvzsQ7kNvgFVV0za&_nc_gid=464d3bd93d2443f5bb8f3fd9b71b47ad&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCT96DvA8ockiuhVMaxw2XgqfYGUkxz8MzI5-SNt9E0LQ&oe=6716E54C&_nc_sid=10d13b","janeyd12",,,,,,,,"0","RIP Father Holt","2023-09-28T17:54:15.000Z","18265064875091943","2","https://scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/352153107_965452577931528_9020609025472660643_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-msp1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=ap7hupIEObIQ7kNvgGzVVoJ&_nc_gid=464d3bd93d2443f5bb8f3fd9b71b47ad&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYALQ1FGx76gWAHqPdwe1M_eHrQtbIBs29_em6Wa-KvutA&oe=6716EDCB&_nc_sid=10d13b","ronan_glynn",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","R.I.P.

Thinking I knew everything, thinking I was an adult. And I was angry. About a lot, like a lot. I was fifteen when I had my daughter. And she was four when I went to prison for the first time. I came out for a little while. My girlfriend and I had another child, then I went in again. But this time my daughter was grown enough to understand where I was going. And that hurt. That’s one of the reasons I never went back. That, and the conversations I had with older men. A lot of them made one mistake and were never getting out. I ‘d messed up twice, and I was getting one more chance. I served 4.5 years. The mother of my children never left my side. She’s a great woman. We met in foster care; we have similar stories. And I came home to a stable home. For a little while I didn’t have to worry about bills. I could just focus on being a father: taking the kids to school every day, making dinner some nights, cooking breakfast on Sunday. I ended up getting a job at a homeless shelter; and that’s what I’ve been doing ever since. I fell in love with it. The people, mainly. Their stories align with mine. When my mother brought us to the shelter, it was the first time I ever felt poor. I was only eight or nine, but I said: ‘I’m always going to have money of my own.’ And that’s what led me to the streets. My daughters are on a different path. The oldest is a junior in high school now. Her grades are excellent, better than mine ever were. She’s got a little baby sister, so we’ve got three girls now. And I’m just a great dad, honestly. A really great dad. Just, I love my kids. And they love me. I can see it. And that’s what I’m proudest of. Because growing up I never had a father; he did 27 years in prison. I never even knew him. So for me—to be a great father, that’s a thing.”","Photo by Humans of New York on November 22, 2022. لا يتوفر وصف

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 22, 2022.","“Get a plant and name it after yourself. I tell that to everyone, especially if they have trouble with self-love. Take care of your plant every day. Water it, make it beautiful. If your plant is growing and nourishing, that means you’re growing and nourishing. If it’s dying, you have to ask: ‘What’s going on with me?’ Every time you see a dead leaf, pluck it off. Say out loud: ‘Get rid of dead relationships in my life.’ That means anyone who is lingering, stealing your energy, blocking your blessings. You need to put yourself first, second, and third. When you’re back to one hundred, then you can take care of the world. I learned that the hard way. I’ve been working since the age of twelve. I’ve been on my own since the age of sixteen. In my apartment there are four plants named after me. There’s Jiu Jitsu Deisy; she’s delicate but dangerous; the vines look like they’re choking each other out. There’s Yoga-Horoscope Deisy; she represents my spiritual life. There’s Rocio, which is the middle name of both me and my mother. I hated that name for a long time, until last year, when I made amends with my mom. Then the last Deisy is Little Deisy. She’s between six other plants, named after women in my life who have nourished me.”","Photo by Humans of New York on September 22,

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 21, 2022.","“I packed on the muscle to cover it up. What our neighbor did to me; when I was a kid. It left such a darkness and shadow inside me. So much anger and sexual confusion. My high school wrestling coaches used to test me for steroids every single week; that’s how much anger and aggression was inside of me. But I didn’t beat up my body with drugs, like some people do. I beat it up in the gym. Working out made me feel embodied. Like nobody would fuck with me. At the age of 21 I decided to train for the Mr. Olympia competition. I was down to 4 percent body fat. I was getting striations like crazy. Then one day I’m riding the elevator at my office, and it froze. It hovered for one second. Then it dropped. I thought I was going to die. It fell three stories before the emergency brakes kicked in. Four herniated discs in my back. Three in my neck. I needed two shoulder operations, a knee operation. I had platinum and titanium wires put into my back. It was months and months of not being able to work out. Sitting in this dark room. No sunshine. All that pain and suffering from my childhood just rushed out. I remember sitting in my wheelchair, next to a busy street, and wanting so bad to just roll over the curb. But this is a comeback story. I’m having a little bit of a comeback right now. After my last spinal surgery, I got the sense that I could lift again. I put on a garbage bag, and walked 2.5 miles a day, in 95-degree heat, carrying weights. I lost 75 pounds. The entire time I was listening to the Rocky music. Eye of The Tiger, on repeat. Rocky is my hero. He wasn’t super smart and neither am I, especially since the brain injury. But we both know how to keep fighting. I even got a tattoo of a tiger on my chest. Its mouth is open. It’s scaring the pain away: not just the physical pain, all of the pain. Right now I’m training for my first competition. It’s just a small one, called Classic Physique. But I went hard today, and I’m feeling super strong. I don’t want anyone feeling sorry for me. I want people to see me on the podium. I want to engrave a sentiment. That if this man can do it, anybody can. This isn’t gonna be a sad story. It’s gonna be a Rocky story.”","Photo by Humans of New York on September 21,

There’s no pressure, and you never want to leave. You want to stay right there and relax. You want that temporary feeling forever. But it goes away, and the pressure always comes back. Life is pressure: job interviews, things you’ve got to do, every day, getting up. It makes you want to go back to that place. I’ve been out here eight years. When I see people go by, I hear different things. People quoting and phrasing what their life is—I only get bits and pieces: ‘We’re going to the movies. We’re getting married. We’re going to Santa Cruz.’ Stuff like that. I can hear it. I know that life is out there; but you have to earn it. Determination and willpower, that’s what I need. There’s a seed in me that wants to stop. There are days I don’t want to get high. I love life. I love life, and I’m gifted. I’m gifted with age. I just turned fifty, and I think there’s more to come. I have the desire to keep going. Sometimes I think, without the drugs-- what am I going to do? That voice is there too. But I have to get rid of that. Because there’s a life out there. There’s a lot more than just getting high.”","Photo by Humans of New York on September 25, 2022.

"Photo by Humans of New York on September 23, 2022.","“I’m aware of it all day, every day. We’re triggered all the time, even the best of us. On the plane ride here. I’m sitting next to a casting director from Broadway, and I asked him what he thought about a particular show. He took a long pause. So I say: ‘I guess you didn’t like it.’ And he tells me: ‘The entertainment industry is forced to put on stories from marginalized communities, even if they’re not good.’ He said that to me. As a Black person. It’s like, dude. I’m just trying to make conversation. And there it is. Suddenly I’m back in my blackness. What am I supposed to do? Do I engage? Do I turn this into a learning moment? Or do I l just let him off the hook? It’s work. That’s what it is. It’s work. That’s my challenge. To walk into a room, and not have to work mentally. To be aware of my blackness; to not forget it. But to also be present. And focused. And productive. Right now I’m at a climate change conference, and I’m one of the only Black people in the room. I’ve had decades of practice, but it still takes me five minutes. To transition. To stop worrying if people believe that I belong here. To stop feeling like a unicorn. It’s five minutes of work that nobody else in the room has to do. It’s a choice to be aware of your whiteness. It’s not a choice to be aware of your blackness. It’s the difference between going to a new upscale restaurant, and going home to Mom’s table. At Mom’s table there’s nothing to figure out. You don’t have to think about what to order. Or what you’re wearing. Or what you’re going to say. You’re at ease. That’s why people go home: so they can feel at ease.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2350","720","1080","https://scontent-bos5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/308192894_459109682923754_5821671224113356350_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-bos5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=AEEna_sgTmAQ7kNvgF_CiZS&_nc_gid=97c4021a2e5a4b9a9568a72250bd8786&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYBZvg-6ZQxZ0veYMwmT0GyZHvcP_UqzgEhSm5_rF7Nw3A&oe=6716C1F6&_nc_sid=10d13b","@jessica.mercedes","2933740122161028223",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/humansofny/",,"false","18261428968144146","0","https://scontent-bos5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/155241477_428005998476853_7173452134544432545_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-bos5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=9AokdHgiYRgQ7kNvgGxSCJ-&_nc_gid=97c4021a2e5a4b9a9568a72250bd8786&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYA9mrPUkvLKo60b4vxgJifhJGR0kkeHq9j1k_7Fu5u0xg&oe=6716E6AC&_nc_sid=10d13b","dolo.nomo",,,,,,,,"0","@jessica.mercedes","2023-05-18T15:13:14.000Z","17984044333965021","1","https://scontent-bos5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/394491418_777020940848790_4745691416778002899_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-bos5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=c7lBamCOZXIQ7kNvgEbCEdY&_nc_gid=97c4021a2e5a4b9a9568a72250bd8786&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYCTb5j-JWdPRYWD6dffnopyoM3S9_ncBMKlq-zoJSNXhw&oe=6716E465&_nc_sid=10d13b","jennyyy_4444",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","❤️❤️ powerful","2023-05-12T11:26:46.000Z","17894320577757895","3","https://scontent-bos5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/11201504_1673395156224247_1639797839_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=scontent-bos5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=VtkN2JIC_KoQ7kNvgF0VTcZ&_nc_gid=97c4021a2e5a4b9a9568a72250bd8786&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYB2s2YpQh-pwhTW2uzpB-FU3mZ_Ea7sRB1Pp3Ck5tgu4A&oe=6716E5AB&_nc_sid=10d13b","hermelaninmagick",,,,,,,,"0","A dozen words in I knew where it was going.
