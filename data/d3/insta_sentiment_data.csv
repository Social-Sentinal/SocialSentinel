Instagram Addiction - How to fix it?,digitalminimalism," Hey guys? Hope you all are doing well.

I have always been addicted to social media (Insta, Youtube and others). Those were easily cutoff cause I didnt get anything productive from them (literally). However, I could delete Instagram because it plays an important role in my social life, but I catch myself wasting hours in the explore/reels page.

1- Does anyone know a way to block these features from the phone in order to just access the conversations page.

2- Another viable solution, would be to set the app limit for certain times of the day (Example: 9-5) however I havent found this option on an Iphone.

How I Broke My Instagram Addiction: A How To Guide,DecidingToBeBetter,"If anyone’s interested in the full article please check the link on my profile!

1 - Make the decision:

The first step is to make the decision that you have had enough. In my opinion, this is the most powerful step. You are committing to taking back control of your life, your time and your decisions.

2 - 48 Hour Detox:

Now that you’ve made your decision it’s time to take action. I recommend removing Instagram from your life completely for a full 48 hours. It feels scary, and the fear of missing out is real however it is a long enough time for you to process the initial and intense feelings that are inevitable after spending so much time every day on the app but short enough that it doesn’t feel like too much to take on at once.

3 - Monitor Your Feelings:

During these 48 hours take note of how you’re feeling. The initial feelings will probably be intense, you will feel like you’re missing out on so much, or that you need to respond to messages or that people will think you’re rude for not responding to them. (If there are people you need to communicate with during this time that you usually communicate with on Instagram, try and find an alternate form of communication for these 48 hours). You will probably feel irritable and stressed, common withdrawal symptoms in the initial stages. I felt these strongly and I was constantly fretting and thinking, maybe I should just check. I found myself constantly and unconsciously going to where the app used to be on my phone. This just indicated to me how much I would repeat that behaviour. However, after the first 24 hours, I had a new sense of clarity that I hadn’t felt in a long time. After the 48 hours I felt positive and motivated that I had made it through this initial stage and this motivation gave me the drive to continue.

4 - Set your Limits

With your newfound clarity over these 48 hours and after, you can now start to set some boundaries for yourself. The goals you choose here are completely up to you. Do you want to?

- Limit your time on the app

- Only access it for certain uses like messaging or looking up businesses or keeping up with family

- Remove yourself from it completely

5 - Increase The Resistance

If you decide that you want to continue to limit your time on the app or if you want to stop using it completely, an effective method is to increase the resistance between your wanting to use the app and actually being able to use it. These can include:

- Setting limit times for yourself

- Signing out of the app

- Deleting the app from your home page

- Deleting the app from your phone

The more you increase the resistance to being able to access the app, the more likely you are to continue with whatever goals and limits you have set for yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/10vy8rk/how_i_broke_my_instagram_addiction_a_how_to_guide/,POSITIVE,0.9952276945114136

"The Instagram addiction method, and why it’s f***ed",Instagram,"Recently I took a break off posting to Instagram, I’m a photographer with a small following (1,270 as I write this) and the algorithm has slowly throttled my engagement, I like and engaged in friends photos, I comment occasionally but don’t really go beyond that, I’m sorry but I don’t care much to spend hours of my life investing in to Instagram to reward me. 

Here’s what I did: 

I switched to a personal account, changed my password, went private. Didn’t post for 2 weeks

Then switched back to a business account, my first post back “exploded” I got thousands of impressions, multiple likes and most of my impressions came from my hashtags. 

The next 3 posts were posted using similar hashtags but changed around completely:

The second post 3 days later, nothing 
4th post a day after that, nothing 
5th post the next day, 113 impressions. 

Instagram does a technique commonly found in gambling machines called “honey potting” which is where they occasionally reward you but more often don’t, this keeps you engaged in the challenge of trying to chase the honey pot. 

Here is an extract from a gambling and addiction website:

The addictiveness of a slot is that it challenges you. At times the game would not provide any winnings and suddenly it gives you a massive payout. This becomes a rush, making you feel as if you knew that a win was coming, which is why you keep spinning.

Basically, for as much as we complain about it, we are all addicts, and they are winning.

How I fixed my Instagram (reels) addiction,INTP,"After a successful experiment where I tricked the algorithm in showing me anime posts (almost hentai looking) for fun, I realized I could trick the algorithm (with some discipline) into showing me whatever I want.

So now it only shows me, about 85% of the time, motivational quotes, things related to grind, stuff that tells you to fix your life and get off of Instagram. Also art, edits. 

Why did I do this? I found out that not only I like these posts more, but they also make me think. Yes! Usually short form content is supposed to be brainless, effortless. For entertainment only. Once the viewer has to do councious thinking they are much more likely to end the loop.

So now every time I open my feed it's full of stuff that after a few minutes gets me self councious of what I'm doing. I also use Instagram for more professional reasons, and this helped me drastically reduce and control the time I am spending on it.

Perhaps it works for other people as well, to trick the algorithm in working against itself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/167424c/how_i_fixed_my_instagram_reels_addiction/,NEGATIVE,0.9971152544021606
An Instagram refresh to curb addiction,nosurf,"I have resisted thinning down the number of people I follow because it feel like a very emotional/drastic thing to do, I’ve followed some of these micro influencers for years and years and I’m so attached but I just REALLY need to control the addictiveness of my feed &amp; get grounded again, so I’m trying out a new tactic:

I have been going to to EVERY SINGLE feed which would not notice if I unfollowed &amp; followed back (I.e. nobody you know personally), saving one of their typical posts to a “used to follow” bookmark folder, &amp; unfollowing them.

This is taking SOME TIME let me tell you, but it feels REALLY good that I know I can just go to this folder if they pop into my head and find them immediately &amp; follow them back at any time.

I’m also going to start a practice where any time I follow someone new, I immediately save a post of theirs to that bookmark folder so that if I need a break from them, they can be perennially unfollowed/followed.

I’m going to try to get my 700+ list down to JUST the people who would notice if I re-followed by NYE &amp; slowly re-follow people from January. There’s a bunch I that I KNOW I’ll re-follow immediately but I want to give myself some legitimate breathing room for 2024.

Anyway, let me know if this vibes with you, I’ve found it quite meditative going through &amp; deleting pages— I’m skipping all my favourites until the end of the year &amp; that kind of proves helpful too since it gets you mindful of which pages legitimately give you value",https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/17mi1zv/an_instagram_refresh_to_curb_addiction/,NEGATIVE,0.9044478535652161

My partner is addicted to Instagram reels and I’m helpless and ready to give up.,nosurf,"Hi everyone!
So for a bit of context this is my long term partner, we’ve been together for 4 years and he is currently 22M. I am 22F, I used to be addicted to short form video and all this stuff but In the past year I have let it go and finally got free, I still keep my social medias but I avoid short form video like a plague and keep them deleted from my phone, works great for me!

Whenever I see my partner, however, he’s constantly in Instagram reels specifically. I looked at his screen report last night and he was spending a minimum 5 hours a day on his phone some days and 4 hours of that is on Instagram reels. This is a guy who works full time and commits to me as well.

He is just CONSTANTLY on it even when I’m around. His idea of quality time is laying on his bed and watching reels together and I’ve watched the clock before and he’s easily scrolled for 20 minutes straight with me beside him and just waiting for him to get off before he finally does.

He watches reels every single chance he gets. While going to the bathroom, an idle moment while cooking, in car rides with me, when we pause a movie for a minute, like come ON. He just can’t put it away.

Yesterday it was a beautiful sunny day out, probably the last super warm day as fall is upon us soon. And he sat on the couch watching reels and I had to BEG him to do something with me. Like no joke I had to forcefully take his phone and like drag his ass to the beach, which then he had a lot of fun of course. On the car ride there I told him I’m kind of worried because he’s not interested in his hobbies no more and I’m worried he’s wasting a ton of time watching just memes and reels. He agreed and also expressed that he hates it and wishes he could just get a flip phone, like we were on the same page.

So after talking he deleted the Instagram app from his phone and I thought it was gone and he was like a new man.

This morning I happen to see his phone while he’s sleeping and he’s getting notifications from Instagram.

Like I’m helpless here, he redownloaded it.

What the heck do I do? He literally never used to be like this I’d say within the last 2-3 years since Covid he’s picked up this annoying habit.

EDIT: not give up on him LOL I mean give up on helping him quit, all of his free time outside me and work is pretty much consumed by watching reels and that concerns me because he doesn’t have many hobbies or anything fulfilling and sits inside most evenings and it makes me sad. I continuously try to help by suggesting activities to do but he just doesn’t do them.

I need help in freeing myself from Instagram addiction,pornfree,"I'm kinda surprised I've never seen this mentioned anywhere else on reddit so far:

I'm addicted to Instagram, I check on random girls pictures everyday, multiple times a day, with multiple fake accounts.  
I got to the point that most of the time I don't even masturbate, I just have the urge to check them out compulsively. 

At first I used to check (on fb) exclusively girls I knew irl which I considered too out of my league, too boring or too high maintenance to give them a shot, then I started checking on local (glamour) photographers, then on ""amateur models"".

When Instagram picked up steam things got even harder (no pun intended):   
through the likes of ""hottest girls of ig"" / ""insta babes"" pages I got myself a factually infinite amount of ""normal"" girls arching their backs, showing their asses on camera and going the extra mile for the clout.

The last nail in the coffin came with the stories:  
The riskier content, the fact that stories are up only for a day, the fear of missing out turned checking and masturbating on ig girls into a compulsion.

When I was a child I dreamed of see-through-clothes glasses, then the future gave us Instagram.

Everytime I come across a girl with a cute face I try to find her ig profile and look for ass pics, and if there aren't any I check on flickr, reddit..   
I come back at her profile every day, checking all her stories, waiting for her to finally give in.  
They all end up showing their bodies given enough time.

It became like gambling for me, this addiction lasted for **more than 7 years** and it's still going strong.

I also believe that my interest for those girls is fundamentally ill-willed: I get off the most to girls who flag themselves as *artist*, *painters*, *musicians, yoga teachers* but post content of little value save for their bodies.

There was this girl which started by posting drawings and pictures with her wearing goth outfits, then she opened an OF with mild nudity.   
At some point she closed it, and when asked why she answered ""Because I want to be known for my art instead of my body"". Goes without fail that she reopened it and post b/g content now.  
Girls crossing their boundaries for validation.

The more a girl crosses the line the more I get bored of her, then I start to look for another innocent looking girl and how long it takes her for going from tame OOTD pics to daily reels in lingerie and bathing suits.

It might come to you as a stretch but I had an easier time quitting actual porn than quitting checking gals on Instagram: no shit, I managed quitting smoking, drinking and even drugs, but with Instagram I am at a loss, having both my dick and my phone in my damn pocket at any given time doesn't help.

I developed ED, I don't get aroused by real girls like I used to but this isn't enough to make me stop.

I need help in freeing myself from Instagram addiction,NoFap," I'm kinda surprised I've never seen this mentioned anywhere else on reddit so far:

I'm addicted to Instagram, I check on random girls pictures everyday, multiple times a day, with multiple fake accounts.  
I got to the point that most of the time I don't even masturbate, I just have the urge to check them out compulsively.

At first I used to check (on fb) exclusively girls I knew irl which I considered too out of my league, too boring or too high maintenance to give them a shot, then I started checking on local (glamour) photographers, then on ""amateur models"".

When Instagram picked up steam things got even harder (no pun intended):  
through the likes of ""hottest girls of ig"" / ""insta babes"" pages I got myself a factually infinite amount of ""normal"" girls arching their backs, showing their asses on camera and going the extra mile for the clout.

The last nail in the coffin came with the stories:  
The riskier content, the fact that stories are up only for a day, the fear of missing out turned checking and masturbating on ig girls into a compulsion.

When I was a child I dreamed of see-through-clothes glasses, then the future gave us Instagram.

Everytime I come across a girl with a cute face I try to find her ig profile and look for ass pics, and if there aren't any I check on flickr, reddit..  
I come back at her profile every day, checking all her stories, waiting for her to finally give in.  
They all end up showing their bodies given enough time.

It became like gambling for me, this addiction lasted for **more than 7 years** and it's still going strong.

I also believe that my interest for those girls is fundamentally ill-willed: I get off the most to girls who flag themselves as *artist*, *painters*, *musicians, yoga teachers* but post content of little value save for their bodies.

There was this girl which started by posting drawings and pictures with her wearing goth outfits, then she opened an OF with mild nudity.  
At some point she closed it, and when asked why she answered ""Because I want to be known for my art instead of my body"". Goes without fail that she reopened it and post b/g content now.  
Girls crossing their boundaries for validation.

The more a girl crosses the line the more I get bored of her, then I start to look for another innocent looking girl and how long it takes her for going from tame OOTD pics to daily reels in lingerie and bathing suits.

It might come to you as a stretch but I had an easier time quitting actual porn than quitting checking gals on Instagram: no shit, I managed quitting smoking, drinking and even drugs, but with Instagram I am at a loss, having both my dick and my phone in my damn pocket at any given time doesn't help.

I developed ED, I don't get aroused by real girls like I used to but this isn't enough to make me stop.

Instagram is becoming as addictive as TikTok,nosurf,"I deleted tiktok primarily because it was sucking the life out of me. The comments on videos are always soooo hypercritical, toxic, and absolutely disgusting. I found myself feeling bad every time I left the app so I just deleted it. I started slowly using Instagram reels (about a year ago) and their algorithm was way better because it was less addictive as they were still figuring it out as it was new. Generally it was a more positive experience that didn’t drain me but now it’s totally changed. The comments are once again insanely negative and hypercritical. Plus their algorithm has drastically improved. I’ve started to use an app for time restrictions and I only unlock it to check my friends’ pages. 

I honestly wish these algorithms were banned. I want to enjoy social media but I don’t want it to take over my life. I’m fed up honestly",https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/14jwb25/instagram_is_becoming_as_addictive_as_tiktok/,POSITIVE,0.7579079270362854

She posts everything we do and had an Instagram live stream for our 3 month anniversary.

I mostly use Reddit and only go on Instagram about 3 times a week to check up on all the post of people I follow. But despite her knowing this, she will get very upset at me when I don’t comment or like her posts less than an hour after they come out.

The event that made me do this poll was yesterday when we were at an ice cream parlor, there was no seats at the bar so we sat in a booth. We got a hot fudge sundae to split and when it was ready I walked up to the counter and got it. On the way back, I took a bite and apon seeing this she got pissed becuase now it was not prestine for her instagram picture. She was very upset and I ended up buying another 20 dollar hot fudge sundae just so she could take a picture of it. This was not great for me becuase I am not rich and do not have disposible income to buy ice cream just to take pictures of. She was upset for the rest of the day and claims it was my fault.

Instagram addict,nosurf,"I’m currently going through a breakup and noticed that my healing process has been completely prolonged because of social media specifically Instagram (with a dash of Facebook). It’s made me so depressed, building narratives about her and if she’s seeing someone new based on new followers and people she’s following— yes I stalked her that often. The problem started way before her. I grew up with social media and Instagram has been an integral part of my life since I was about 15 and am now 29. The depressions get worse as I get older ans this break up was the catalyst. I felt completely out of control in trying to take hold of my impulses. Instead I kept stalking her, her friends or anything that’ll help mitigate my pain. Obviously it’s a vicious feedback loop and end up feeling worse. So I deactivated Instagram and Facebook and it’s day 5. I’m struggling because I feel isolated and scared and pretty lonely.

I changed my Instagram and Pinterest algorithms and I broke my online shopping addiction,Cool_AntiConsumption,"I have WAY too many clothes for one woman, and for years it seemed like I couldn't stop shopping. Online shopping (mostly thredup but also some pricey sustainable fashion retailers) seemed like an addiction for me. Especially during the pandemic, where I added up that I spent over $2,000 on clothes alone in one year from online shopping.

A few weeks ago I realized it was the images I was being fed in Pinterest and Instagram that triggered the clothes shopping urge for me. I would see pictures of girls wearing a cute outfit and feel like I needed to have it to get that look. But then a few weeks ago I realized - it would never end. There would always be a new look, a new image to copy. I used to be a fashion leader but for years I have felt more like a fashion follower.

So I finally did something. 

In Pinterest, I created a board called ""Board I created just to change my Pinterest algorithm."" Then I searched for terms for things I actually like, like geology, female scientists, earth science, etc. Every time a cool science image came up I saved it to my new board. I did this relentlessly for days. Now my Pinterest feed is mostly posts about women working outdoor jobs, homesteading, geology posts, geology art, and diy gardening and very few fashion posts. So much more boring but so much more important.

In Instagram, every time a fashion ad came in my feed, I clicked ""Hide Ad,"" ""It's irrelevant."" Again, I did the relentlessly, but it took weeks. Instagram was relentless in sending me fashion ads but I made no exceptions and hid every single fashion ad they fed me. Now my ads are for things like skincare and jewelry that I can control myself around and I don't click on.

I feel like a capitalist rebel and I love it. I just wanted to share how this worked for me. I haven't bought any clothes online since I did this and it really seems to help.

How I fixed my Instagram (reels) addiction,INTP,"After a successful experiment where I tricked the algorithm in showing me anime posts (almost hentai looking) for fun, I realized I could trick the algorithm (with some discipline) into showing me whatever I want.

So now it only shows me, about 85% of the time, motivational quotes, things related to grind, stuff that tells you to fix your life and get off of Instagram. Also art, edits. 

Why did I do this? I found out that not only I like these posts more, but they also make me think. Yes! Usually short form content is supposed to be brainless, effortless. For entertainment only. Once the viewer has to do councious thinking they are much more likely to end the loop.

So now every time I open my feed it's full of stuff that after a few minutes gets me self councious of what I'm doing. I also use Instagram for more professional reasons, and this helped me drastically reduce and control the time I am spending on it.

Perhaps it works for other people as well, to trick the algorithm in working against itself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/167424c/how_i_fixed_my_instagram_reels_addiction/,NEGATIVE,0.9971152544021606

# Dad Specific Issues

**Personality** \- My dad used to be the prim and proper kind of person, who would arrange documents diligently and neatly as and when required, be it insurance, bills, warranty cards, itr returns, you name an activity and he would have a neat file with all the indexation ready.

**Routine before** \-the morning routine used to be breakfast with newspaper, followed by a quick news channel sesssion then off to work we go. The evening/post work routine used to be relax for a while before dinner followed by all the personal tasks like bill payment, documentation, letter/email writing, investment research etc.

**Routine for the last few years** \- personal hygiene routine remains unchanged, but every fragment of knowledge resource has been substituted by mobile. Every free second of the day is spent on phone. While having breakfast/lunch/dinner, in the leisure time, etc. 

**Repercussions** \- 

* Firstly the ""sanskaar"" edits/captioned images, iykyk (the kind where chanakya or krishna or someone else is giving a lesson on the duties of an ideal son/ideal wife/ideal family), ive personally stopped downloading them and just ignore them as it is.. 
* Secondly, he has stopped his documentation habits and now just stuffs all the important documents in his almirah, work desk, dining table, every book shelf in house, etc etc and has consequently turned all of his and our personal space into a dumping yard, we have documents all around us but when needed we can find nothing.. this is not only ruining the look of the house, but also creating problems, some exhibits of the same are - Exhibit A: he forgot to replace the insurance policy in the car lately and just drove off to a distant place (now digital documents always exist but still carrying physicals is always advisable).. Exhibit B: last year he misplaced his form16A,B three times and started blaming everyone but himself, Exhibit C: a couple of months ago he went to the hospital for some medical procedure and he couldnt find the insurance policy, then again he went on to blame everyone but himself. exhibit D: misplaced original FD certificates then blamed everyone.

P.S. Im a grown adult and I help him in all the ways I can, but he aint that old to be completely dependent on me,, he is still working and I expect him to manage his own basic documentation himself atleast for now..

# Mom Specific Issues

**Personality** \- sweet simple housewife, no external responsibilities but a lot of domestic chores, 

**Routine before** \- aided by an army of domestic helpers, she used to be the manager of house.. 

**Routine now** \- fulfilling all her responsibilities diligently, cant complaint about anything about her,, just that life has become a risky around her

**Repurcussions**

* Doesnt pick up any emergency calls, since she is always on earphones watching something or the other on netflix or talking to her relatives, its been so many times that I call her from market about something important and my calls are always on hold or unanswered, I have to drive back to home and do the task myself then,, and when i complaint about not answering my call, guess what, her answer is -""haan abhi mausi se baat kar rahi, baad mein batana""
* Cooking while on video calls/watching shows - this is a life risk for all, as ive myself atleast 10-12 times in the last 1 year found the stove turned on for no reason.. food burnt... milk overflowing... tap unclosed
* Oh also, Anupama inspired dialogues.. ughhhhhh.

# Common Issues

* Arguing aimlessly on family/society whatsapp groups in favour of/against particular political parties/leaders
* The online shopping epidemic - my house is now filled with stuff we never used nor will ever use, for ex my dad has in the last year ordered 5 ties, just because they were at a good price/looking good.. the issue however is that the last time he wore a tie in 2006... we have outgrown three shoeracks in the last couple of years and just last week another shoerack arrived.
* No time to spend with each other or me.. I myself am not addicted to social media,, i only watch cricket, im not on instagram, facebook, I read books in my free time and do my work the other time.. so there is an obvious growing distance bw me and them and whenever i bring this up there answer is ""what else do we do at this age now, we dont have any other hobbies, nor do we wanna develop hobbies now"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/13i2294/parents_addicted_to_reels_and_facebook_and_its/,NEGATIVE,0.9921471476554871

My partner is addicted to Instagram reels and I’m helpless and ready to give up.,nosurf,"Hi everyone!
So for a bit of context this is my long term partner, we’ve been together for 4 years and he is currently 22M. I am 22F, I used to be addicted to short form video and all this stuff but In the past year I have let it go and finally got free, I still keep my social medias but I avoid short form video like a plague and keep them deleted from my phone, works great for me!

Whenever I see my partner, however, he’s constantly in Instagram reels specifically. I looked at his screen report last night and he was spending a minimum 5 hours a day on his phone some days and 4 hours of that is on Instagram reels. This is a guy who works full time and commits to me as well.

He is just CONSTANTLY on it even when I’m around. His idea of quality time is laying on his bed and watching reels together and I’ve watched the clock before and he’s easily scrolled for 20 minutes straight with me beside him and just waiting for him to get off before he finally does.

He watches reels every single chance he gets. While going to the bathroom, an idle moment while cooking, in car rides with me, when we pause a movie for a minute, like come ON. He just can’t put it away.

Yesterday it was a beautiful sunny day out, probably the last super warm day as fall is upon us soon. And he sat on the couch watching reels and I had to BEG him to do something with me. Like no joke I had to forcefully take his phone and like drag his ass to the beach, which then he had a lot of fun of course. On the car ride there I told him I’m kind of worried because he’s not interested in his hobbies no more and I’m worried he’s wasting a ton of time watching just memes and reels. He agreed and also expressed that he hates it and wishes he could just get a flip phone, like we were on the same page.

So after talking he deleted the Instagram app from his phone and I thought it was gone and he was like a new man.

This morning I happen to see his phone while he’s sleeping and he’s getting notifications from Instagram.

Like I’m helpless here, he redownloaded it.

What the heck do I do? He literally never used to be like this I’d say within the last 2-3 years since Covid he’s picked up this annoying habit.

EDIT: not give up on him LOL I mean give up on helping him quit, all of his free time outside me and work is pretty much consumed by watching reels and that concerns me because he doesn’t have many hobbies or anything fulfilling and sits inside most evenings and it makes me sad. I continuously try to help by suggesting activities to do but he just doesn’t do them. His dopamine receptors are probably so burnt out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/169plor/my_partner_is_addicted_to_instagram_reels_and_im/,NEGATIVE,0.9979738593101501
"Our story, FB reels, maybe not addiction?",loveafterporn,"3 weeks ago,I found that he had looked at Facebook reels and had jerked off the night before. I even found the tissue, still wet. This broke my heart as I was in the house and to sleep in our bed. He was on the couch because he was sick with covid. But intimacy is a very important part of our relationship. To me, jerking off when I'm available instead of giving me the privilege of providing him with sexual release is devastating. I don't have to receive anything in return, I can simply handle anything he needs whether it's a handjob or oral. He was sick, he was trying to go back to sleep, I get it. I don't necessarily like it, but I understand.

There are two factors here that hurt me.

1. First of all is that he did not allow me the privilege of giving him the satisfaction he was needing. It's not about me having an orgasm, it's about me giving him one. Does my desire to give him an orgasm and the heartbreak of finding out that he did not allow me to, does that make me selfish?

2. The second part is the subject matter. My first husband was addicted to pornography and completely replaced me with it for our entire 20 plus year marriage. It was the cause of our demise. So I feel like a beaten dog! When I see the signs I start shaking and freak out. I can't help it.

I scoured his internet history and his Facebook history. I cannot find any evidence of anything else. I truly do not believe that he is an addict or that this is an ongoing problem for him. But now the fear is planted and I cannot get it out.

We literally cannot have a conversation without me freaking out about this. He feels that I was spying and snooping and overlooking his privacy. He is embarrassed and ashamed. He did tell me that he was sorry and it was a genuine, heartfelt apology. I told him that in our relationship, we have no secrets. Or that I didn't think we did. Basically, it is his belief that I'm chastising him for masturbating. I'm not. I'm trying to be understanding because I understand he needed to take care of business. But he needs to understand that I love and cherish that aspect of our relationship and will give anything I can to protect it! But I have paid for it with my mental health for the last 3 weeks and that's not okay. At first I was safety seeking, then I was pain shopping, and this whole thing is just a mess. I don't even know why I'm posting this. He's not horrible to me, sex is always amazing, he works very hard to make sure I'm satisfied repeatedly. Maybe he needed to get off and knew that he had covid and did not want to expose me, did not want to wake me in the middle of the night, or maybe it was just easier than to put all of the effort into sex when he just needed a basic release. I would have done that for him! And I didn't need anything in return! But the problem is that he is so giving sexually that he would have felt horrible to just take and not give, so now I'm talking in circles.

I make no excuses for him although I am trying to be understanding and rational about it. I'm trying to think with my head and get it out of my heart, but our sex life is ingrained in my heart so there is really no shaking that off.

I did not find any further evidence, and believe me when I tell you I went back as far as I could. I even found history from 10 years ago and there was nothing. The man is not capable of hiding his tracks because he is not technologically literate.

I think we are going to be okay. But the thing is I have to figure out how to get this out of my mind without bringing it up over and over and over. Because I am driving myself crazy, so I can only imagine how he feels. I just wish he could imagine how I feel about what happened. 

This time, I make no apologies for freaking out or wanting to protect what is near and dear to my heart. I have had a relationship that I cherished to go sour due to pornography and masturbation. I am not willing to let this relationship go south because of it. But the more that I bring this up, and the more time I spend not getting over it, the more damage is happening to the relationship. He did take responsibility for the masturbation and that's fine. I can get past that. But the time frame of getting past this incident it's taking too long for me personally.

Please don't tell me to leave him because I'm not going to. I truly and honestly did not find what I thought I would, what I expected to find. I just need to know how to make peace with this and shut the hell up.

Instagram (unanimously) decided to end my mindless Scrolling Reels addiction,Instagram,"A bit of stats for my nerds out there.
Daily screen time: 5/6+ hours
Monthly Data Use (not wifi): ±90gb average
Wifi data use: let's not talk about it.

Why is this relevant? Well, I sometimes found myself watching reels for hours at a time, like entering into a story with a reel from a friend, and from there, watching X amounts of reels for X amounts of hours, only to exit the reel queue and finding myself in the story that started it all.

BUT NOW! I'm being cut short... Now, when ever I enter a reel, be it from a story or from explore, I'm limited to 3 reels before it completely stops letting me scroll, so I have to EXIT the queue and interact with the rest of the content, or other reels. The the amount of work is just so much,  therefore when I exit the first 3 reels queue, that's it for instagram (for a brief 10 minutes)

Am I complaining? No. Do I like it? On one hand, yes, on the other, also yes... Finally, after trying many methods like apps, timers, you name it, it's instagram the one finally fighting against my crippling addiction (Yes I know will power talk, excuses and bla bla bla).

Thought of sharing because I found it interesting... does any of you experience the same? Would like to know

My years long journey of reeling in my internet addiction.,nosurf,"Let me preface this by saying that I was a long-term Facebook user, joining at the end of middle school around the time they opened up the site to non-college students.  This has been my general path towards getting away from my phone, and it's taken roughly 7 years of life changes to get to this point.  The general trend is that I identified something that was gluing me to my phone and tried to find some more productive alternative.

* Kicking Facebook and Instagram was the first step.  I used to be a pretty active user, but I was getting stressed out by their censorship and assistance with the surveillance state, their usage of AI to hold people's attention, etc.  This was actually fairly easy to replace with in person interaction because I was part of an activist organization that pushed this anyway.  This was my main form of pulling away for a while but I was still pretty glued to things like reddit and YouTube.

* I had a slow process of replacing daily gaming with Yoga.  This was actually pretty hard but I would just force myself to do a yoga video instead of turning on my PS4 before work.  Yoga was really important establishing a routine away from my phone.  It felt too good and trained my concentration.

* I got a cheap phone that could only really use reddit/browsing and YouTube as outlets for entertainment effectively.

* I left a job I despised that I was slacking off on YouTube all day.  New job is way better and my 5g is really bad at the office.

* My daughter was born, pushing me to be more present, killed what was left of my daily gaming career, and I also want to be a good model for tech usage for her.

* Started journaling which has taken up even more of my time, and helped me have an alternative outlet to posting on Reddit.  It also has a stabilizing effect on my mood.

* I recently turned my phone grayscale, it is now almost painful to look at for more than a couple minutes, and I almost immediately get bored after just a couple minutes of scrolling.  Reddit and YouTube are almost totally unappealing without color.

* I see the light at the end of the tunnel, my goal right now is to stop using reddit completely and only journal (this post was actually from my journal).  I also want to only use YouTube for music at work.  I feel like I've almost successfully reigned in my smartphone usage and could potentially move to a flip phone.  I don't actually use my phone much anymore and just wanted to post my experience to hopefully help others out.

Essentially I tried to identify lacks that my smartphone was filling in and tried filling them in with more productive activities, while making the experience of using the phone as painful as possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/11fpnkb/my_years_long_journey_of_reeling_in_my_internet/,NEGATIVE,0.9893711805343628

"Deleted all my social media, now what?",adhdwomen,"So, there have been a lot of motivational videos popping up on my YouTube feed, especially those dopamine detox ones. I know dopamine detox is not a foolproof method, but I've been spending hours on reels and tiktok, maybe 6 hours in total, sometimes more. It's harder for people with adhd to break the addiction (it's an addiction for me), but I'm willing to try! I deleted tiktok a long time ago, but kept with the reels from Instagram, it was only yesterday that I decided to delete it too. 

Now my problem with those detox and motivational videos is that they never give options on what to do instead of being on your phone! There was a time where I was my most productive! I always did my bed, did the dishes, and I even started relearning how to draw! I was doing a 30-day exercise on my mini sketchbook (it was just 5 minutes per day) and then I watched a bigger and more detailed video on anatomy while taking notes and drawing. I felt amazing (i still had tiktok and reels tho). It went downhill when I had to go to my father's house and then my boyfriend stayed there for the night and we just watched anime and movies. The routine broke and with that ""break"", I can't seem to get back. Plus, it's my first day of period and I always have lots of pain and no motivation, so that'll make it harder...

Bethany's marriage is falling apart: an essay,FundieSnarkUncensored,"We've predicted it long before even Davey Jr was in the picture but now its getting more and more painfully obvious.

# Bethany Searches for Unhappy Marriage Content

A few weeks ago, she posted this story about how making fun of your marriage, spouse, and sex life was allegedly a way to be popular on Instagram. Naturally, we were all confused because unless you are actively searching for that boomer brand of ""mArRiAge bAD"" and ""wIFe bAD"" content on IG, there's no reason your feed would be flooded with that type of terrible ""humor"".

# Bethany Posts Unhappy Marriage Content

Even more damning, despite claiming that anti-marriage and spousal complaints are the ""norm"" and how she doesn't find this type of content funny.....it's exactly the type of content she posts.

# Sex as a Replacement for Emotional Intimacy

We've been speculating as to why Bethany has suddenly started posting softcore bukkake reels after a lifetime of peddling purity culture and modesty. It may be for attention, it may be a newfound comfort with her own sexuality, or it may be because her and Dav have never really had any real emotional intimacy to begin with and having more sex (or at least posting about it) is their band-aid to a problem that's been festering in the background for years.

I genuinely think it's only recently that Bethany has had ""better"" sex (and I use that term rather loosely knowing how shit and non-existent sex-ed is for fundies). The first year of marriage and her pregnancy were happy because she was finally validated by being married and not being a diseased Single^(TM). God ""blessed"" her with a baby while Kristen suffered her third miscarriage and now she could rub that in her sister's face as payback for when Kristen rubbed her singleness in her face. Those two things are not even remotely similar, but we're dealing with a severely emotionally demented individual here.

Anyways, once Davey Jr was born and up until the past few months, she was caught up with the daily realities of parenting and probably didn't have much time to dwell on her marriage other than to reminisce about the ""good old days"" when she was the  bride and had no real responsibilities in life.

But now Davey is a toddler and his parents can try to reconnect again. Except, they realize they actually have fucking nothing in common. Bethany looks down on Dav's interests, Dav doesn't understand her IG addiction, Dav is happiest when he's away from her, and most of the stories they filmed together contained a bunch of passive aggressive sniping and performative bullshit. So what else can they possibly do when they have nothing in common and have no shared interests? More sex, I guess.

And because Bethany still seeks emotional validation through her social media addiction, she also has to proclaim r/ihavesex to her followers through cringey reels and ""spicy"" advice no one asked for. So while Bethany and Dav are probably having more sex and ***maybe*** Bethany is gaining some self-awareness with regards to the way purity culture damaged her view of her own sexuality, it's a giant bandaid to their lack of emotional closeness and genuine love. As it stands, they simply aren't very compatible and will likely continue to grow apart as Bethany regularly seeks emotional validation from social media (instead of her husband) because of her deep-seated self-esteem issues and Dav has pretty much emotionally checked out completely, save for parenting their son.

# She's No Longer Special

GirlDefined and the Baird family defines womanhood and a woman's worth by marital status and doing your godly duty of having kids. Bethany has already done all that. Her ""glory days"" were when she was courting, engaged, married, and pregnant. Now that that's all over, the only thing she can do is milk those three year old video clips from her own wedding day or repost the same story about her ugly engagement ring or talk about how ""qUiRkY"" it is that she bought a wedding dress during Kristen's bridal appointment. Despite giving birth, even exploiting her son for insta clout doesn't seem to emotionally validate her as much as content about dating, marriage, and sex---the only things that seem to give her any value.

Within in her own family:

**Kristen** \- adopted two boys  
**Ellissa** \- got married to a taller man and is pregnant with a baby girl  
**Rebekah** \- courting Doug Fundie and will probably be engaged any day now

Now she's been ""dethroned"" and she can't stand that. Now she's finally gotten the chance to hit ""pause"" and evaluate her life choices and realize she's actually miserable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FundieSnarkUncensored/comments/rufrdq/bethanys_marriage_is_falling_apart_an_essay/,NEGATIVE,0.9911093711853027

I've enjoyed this game for most of the time it's been available. It's very addicting, and easy to just set down and roll dice while I'm at my desk working. 

At first with the new sticker sets, it seemed like they were actually listening to the community to make it a little easier to finish sets after the last ones. I was very surprised to get even gold stickers from green packs.

However, after this partner event, I fully believe that this game is rigged just to reel people into microtransactions. I'm glad, but also sickened, it's not just me that only hits the lowest amount on this spinner. 

I can't speak for everyone else, but I play games like these because it's nice to feel like a winner for the few minutes of gameplay. Games are supposed to be enjoyable, an escape from reality sometimes. 

There are strategies that people do to try and get ahead, but at the end of the day, this isn't a skill based game at all. I'm not going to continue playing a game that I will lose at every time because things aren't in my control based on ""skill level"".

"Insta, Tiktok and Porn: the similarity.",NoFap,"Porn isn’t as bad, as the act of switching from one video to another in the interval of a few minutes, or even seconds

Everything that gives sharp dopamine releases in such short intervals (changing from one porn video to another, reels on insta, memes, tiktoks) is detrimental to focus in general, because the minds creates a dependency on such neurological sparks of pleasure. So we miss them, when we don’t have them. We miss touching our phones, getting that notification to see if some one has messaged us. 

All these big tech companies abuse psychology to create technology that makes you addicted. No joke: this is their ‘target’, while hiring heavily paid psychologists in their firms. 

For them it is as simple as more revenue from more time people spend watching their advertisements, and so they TELL their in-house psychologists to make it more addicting. Something you cannot do without. 


So you lose focus. You lose time. Most of all, you lose your self dependence. You can’t read 5 pages of a book without a longing that makes you incomplete as a person. 

Remember, insta, tiktok and xvideos are all run by big, wealthy men. 

They are analogous to scientists who make a rat run through mazes and puzzles to get to the cheese pieces in the middle. Such rats will have no other ability, other than running through those mazes. Without these mazes of insta, tiktok and xvideos, such people feel purposeless. 

It’s hell. The same thing repeated over and over again. Just so these owners who ask technology to be made more and more addicting can become bigger and bigger. They feed on our psychological and biological reality to trap us in this constant loop, 

The result? You lose the ability to look at your partner or your mom and smile and breathe and enjoy their company. Because I need my cheeze! I need my maze! You lose the ability to have determination and energy to sit through an online meeting or lecture or class, forget about building your own legacy. That’s the price. You lose ability . You lose Freedom. Freedom.

He’s *very* introverted and usually dislikes the holidays and family gatherings in general. He’ll go for me and his parents, but he’s usually super quiet and is pretty bad at faking it. He almost *always* says he’s not feeling well in order to excuse his quietness and to try to leave early.

At his parents’ Christmas gathering, he was super quiet again. It’s worth noting we all had negative Covid tests. He complained all day he wasn’t feeling well, and actually went to nap in his childhood bedroom for a few hours. His energy was 0%. When we took family photos he could barely even muster a smile, he genuinely looked miserable. It was only us, his parents, and his brother + wife and kids, so his absence was noticed. His parents seemed a little hurt but understood.

It’s fine, I’m used to it, I hung out with my in-laws watching hallmark movies and eating TONS of great food. I had a blast. 

When we got home, he asked if I had a good time. I did, but pointed out that he has a tendency to be really avoidant during gatherings. I mentioned that he always conveniently feels under the weather and disappears to his room and leaves me to socialize alone. It’s becoming a trend and he should examine why he suddenly feels so unwell every time we visit his parents. He was pretty upset and said he was trying, but he really did feel exhausted.

Well, this morning I woke up, made some coffee, but could NOT wake up. I felt so tired and I just wanted to go back to bed. I went to go make a second cup, and realized… I had bought decaf coffee by mistake. I didn’t notice because I also get Starbucks when we go out- my husband usually only drinks coffee from home. 

Now I have to go apologize to my husband…

TL;DR Bought decaf coffee, blamed my husband for being a Christmas zombie

ETA: So according to Reddit I am a horrible wife, my husband is either severely depressed or has aspergers, and we have a crippling caffeine addiction and need to re-evaluate our lives.

Guys, it’s not that deep. He’s introverted, we joke that I do the talking for the both of us. It works really well for us - I pull him out of his shell when he needs it, and he reels me back into mine when I need it. The holidays are exhausting and we had a humorous misunderstanding. We chuckled about it and moved on - after drinking lots full strength coffee ;)",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/rp0dk7/tifu_by_gaslighting_my_husband_for_christmas/,NEGATIVE,0.9984834790229797

Social Media is corrupting our generation's minds like a slow poison.,india,"NOTE- This is my (m26) first reddit post, so bear with me if I have not expressed properly with my words below-

I started using social media back when there was BSNL broadband connection to computers. 

15 years down the line, I have quit Facebook, like 5 years ago, because I started noticing how FB started feeding radicalised news based on algorithms.

Back then, instagram was a cute little app, where one can post square sized photos.

But now, it has psychologically forced our generation into the fake SHOW-OFF culture.
I have removed Insta just few weeks ago.
Everybody is happy, everyone is a travel/food blogger, every story needs to be aesthetically pleasing.

Everyone is making reels in hope to get famous, monetize this process, focus more on content creation, people claiming that they earn in lakhs and crores, these gamers and vloggers-

That makes me wonder, Does the formal education and getting a job have any value left now?

I have seen people create reels of how their wedding night went.- Where on earth is privacy?

Women have started clickbait thumbnails to get more views.
Are we too lost in western culture that we almost forgot ours?
Or would you just call it ""Times have changed. This is the new India. That's how it is""

Edit- Netflix's Social Dilemma has very well explained how Insta was designed to be addictive. Prior to that, neither did I give a single thought about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/11hvbwl/social_media_is_corrupting_our_generations_minds/,NEGATIVE,0.9993495345115662

My friend is trying to get me to quit nofap,NoFap,"Yesterday, my friend(16m) sent me a reel that says masturbating 2 times and week is good for you.As I(15m) know he is an addict who is not even trying to recover, I asked him if he could go 90 days without porn and fapping. He kept avoiding the question and kept saying its good for your testosterone level. He calls it 'a good addiction'. I told him if he is an addict and couldn't go 90 days without porn and fapping, that shows his lack of discipline and he told me 2 times a week is his 'discpline'. I haven't talked to him since. I thought of his 'discipline' as a alcoholic or saying smoking daily is their 'discipline'. I quit trying to get him out of his addiction. Its his choice if he wants to live his life to the fullest as a guy with discpline or live his live as an addict, only finding happiness in his addiction.

Insta/TikTok worse than porn,NoFap,"I had been getting off to porn for more than a decade when I decided enough was enough. This was about 3 years ago when lockdown had started. Then I started to indulge in Insta and TikTok reels after a short while. I thought I was essentially stepping it down by going that way, but little did I know then how things would transpire. A few months or so into this new addiction, I started experiencing the symptoms of PIED, but I was too numb to give an f since it was lockdown and I couldn’t meet women. I realize now that the dopamine hits that you get from scrolling through endless reels on these platforms in a short time span over stimulates you to the point where you no longer can look at (or imagine) one woman and jerk off. I would edge looking at hundreds of reels, and it kinda became a ritual beyond a point. Looking back now, I feel this has had a worse effect on me than porn ever did, as it only used to be a few videos at a time back then, whereas with these apps, it is insane. The fact that most of these chicks are regular people adds to the excitement and somewhere in the primitive brain, I’m assuming they feel more attainable, thereby feeding the addiction.

I only recently discovered this forum and I am really grateful cause every time there’s an urge, I get on here to read someone’s story and that has kept me motivated. Nearing two weeks PMO free now. Next step is to reduce my phone usage as I realize how a dopamine detox could work very well with the streak and possibly lead to a more wholesome healing process.

TLDR: I got off porn only to fall into the vile habit of beating it to Insta/TikTok reels, and I can swear that this habit is worse as you are looking at so many more women in a short while, leading to potentially larger dopamine surges.

I hope to get through to 30 days first, and then maybe look beyond. Stay strong everyone!",https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/162t5mu/instatiktok_worse_than_porn/,NEGATIVE,0.9996868371963501
Are you addicted to Social Media?,AskUK,"I'm sure we're all addicted to some degree, and I'm sure I'm not as bad as some but I find the whole thing so frustrating! If I let myself I can easily loose hours a day just doom scrolling and I hate it. I only have FB, IG and YT but even those three are enough to suck my time. 
The introduction of reels and shorts have made the those quick dopamine hits so addictive, that when I should be working I find myself on my phone, when I want to spend time on my hobbies I say to myself I'll just have a quick look on my phone first, an hour later that hobby time has gone!
I use will power to stop myself using it as much but it doesn't last forever, some days I won't go on it at all, other days I'm all over it on and off.

 I don't want to delete the apps as I use IG for my business and I like the long form content on YT, I'm going to delete FB as there's no positives there. Even then though  I know I'll go on YT and get hooked into the shorts, I'll go on Insta for work and get hooked into the Reels. I've tried the apps that restrict usage but I just delete them and carry on.

It's not terribly bad but I can just see all the time I'm using when I could be doing more fun, positive and productive things. 

Anyone else struggle with this?

Instagram scrolling,selfimprovement,"I cannot stop scrolling instagram.

It’s not even the posts it’s the mindless infinite scroll reels of instant gratification quick pops of dopamine.

This is not normal for me. I deleted tiktok a year ago after realizing it’s power over me but it doesn’t help that every single app has now integrated a tiktok algorithm into it, even fkn Snapchat.

I have deleted insta multiple times, used screen time restrictions, used a phone lockbox, you name it. I always come back. 

I think the trouble lies in the fact I am 20M in university and meet people who always ask for it and stuff like that. 

I also genuinely like connecting with my distant family and friends and do not feel that the actual social side of the app is detrimental to me whatsoever as I also don’t use that side too too frequently ( maybe 3-5 minutes daily ).

How can I just stop scrolling reels. I could literally sit here and scroll reels for 7 hours straight my addiction is so bad.

Also other than this I have worked out consistently for years as well as train jiu jitsu, eat clean, get good grades, read philosophy and self help, but this scrolling addiction is literally harder to quit than when I quit nicotine.

Accounts promoting Only Fans accounts shouldn't be allowed on social media.,TrueUnpopularOpinion,"Most children under 18 are on social media. I'm only familiar with TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram. Each of these apps have front page or ""reel"" algorithms that promote different categories based on the users interests. One of those categories in each of the apps is half naked women showing off their ass and tits often to promote their OF. 

I've tested and manipulated each of these algorithms so that nearly all I saw was ass and tits in order to prove that it is a distinct category in their algorithm. The longer you watch, the more profiles you click, and the more you like will promote the category more. Since it is a defined category in the algorithm, this means that these social media companies are aware they exists and have the ability to suppress them.

These algorithms are training children to have a porn addiction. Another alternative solution could be having a separate 18+ version of the app. There's a reason China who owns TikTok doesn't allow their children access to the full site.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1529wcg/accounts_promoting_only_fans_accounts_shouldnt_be/,NEGATIVE,0.9892889261245728

I think porn addiction may have just ruined my life,pornfree,"I (22M) work a job that sometimes requires me to work on weekends at unsociable hours. I was working a Saturday at 5pm. I was waiting for something to load on a computer and thought I might aswell browse Instagram. I start watching reels and stumble upon an NSFW reel.

I was in a room along a corridor with a small window in the door looking at my phone at an angle where someone from the outside may have been able to see what I was looking at. 

I presumed I was the only one on the in the office and  kept watching more of this persons reels until I ended up following the link to their twitter where I saw even more NSFW stuff. I carry on watching because I'm an addict and my tiny stupid lizard brain craves to see women naked. 

This is the first time I've done this at work and it was because I acted without thinking.

It wasn't until I heard someone's voice in the corridor that I realised I wasn't the only one in the office I was unsure if they saw what I was doing. My fear is that they did and that come next week I'll be fired for doing what I did.

For context this is a career I've worked hard for and has become a part of me and because of my addiction I gambled this dream job for a quick cheap thrill. I'm not going to try and weasel out of this and if I get fired it's because I deserved it because watching porn at work is form of sexual harassment to my fellow co workers. 

I'm more worried about the fact of explaining this to my friends, family and girlfriend. No one knows I've been fighting this addiction for years (failing miserably at it too).

Instagram “Mini Gurus” are dangerously obsessed with consumerism,BeautyGuruChatter,"I’ve noticed lately that a lot of pages on Instagram are so caught up in buying every new release it’s just toxic and unhealthy. 

A common trend in these micro influencers who buy too much is that not all, but most of them, are stay at home moms. What they typically do is take flatlays of their makeup to post to their feed, and then they discuss their makeup of the day in their Instagram stories as well as do un boxings. They have nice personalities and everything but everytime they buy something it’s the same excuse, “oh this was so pretty I HAD to pick it up”, “I had to try this because my friend here on insta recommended it”, “I tried to resist but I just couldn’t”, stuff like that. 

Their purchases of so many things are never justified, and honestly couldn’t be because they own waaay too much stuff, so they just laugh off every purchase they make and occasionally say “I’m addicted” or “I need to stop” as a joke, when really they’ve got a shopping addiction and they DO need to stop.

There’s one girl I follow who will start a month long no buy and place an order 15 out of the 30 days in the month, and she just constantly has packages arriving and has showed her room that’s cluttered full of makeup. If you wear makeup everyday and use a lot of your stuff, that’s one thing, but she wears makeup like once or twice a week because she works, meanwhile she has a ridiculous amount of eyeshadow palettes piled into her drawers. She mentions that she wants to move out of what I’d assume is her parents house and get her own apartment and I honestly feel sorry for her, because if she got the proper help and saved money instead of blowing everything on makeup, she’d probably be able to afford rent. It’s a straight up addiction at this point and she needs somebody to intercede and tell her to stop buying stuff because she never uses it.

I just hope the influence of these women doesn’t imprint onto younger tweens and teenagers who don’t know how to manage money, not to mention it’s just unhealthy for anyone of any age to be hearing these messages that if an eyeshadow palette looks pretty, buy it!

"My [25] wife [24] is obsessed with trying to get our toddler daughter [22m] ""discovered"" on instagram to be a model.",relationships,"I love my wife but she refuses to go back to work and all she does is spend all the money left over from the job I hate but work to support them on new outfits every day for our kid because she wants to make her a 'brand rep' on Instagram so she can eventually get discovered as a model and 'make money' and 'be famous' and 'get free stuff'. She won't even work on the 3 days a week our kid goes to child care for socialisation. She uses it as time to nap and get her nails done.

My sister called her out on it and said that she is teaching our daughter that her only value is in her looks and what she is wearing/if she has the 'latest' clothes and that it's a really poor message to send to our child. My wife lashed out at my sister for that and is now trying to freeze her out. But I think my sister had a point.

I told my wife that I think she needs to stop doing this and now she is giving me the guilt trip for not 'supporting her' as a SAHM and not loving my daughter enough because 'don't you want her to have nice things'. Of course I do, but no child needs $250 a week spent on its wardrobe. 

Don't know what to do. I feel like if I push it too far, it will end badly, but I think this needs to stop.

(She'd already spent most of the day doing his 'lessons'.) I told her that was outside our agreement, I was leaving. She said if it's like that just break up with me then. So I did.

UPDATE: (yeah like 4th time sorry)

We got back in touch because she found out the organization indeed IS a pyramid scheme and it's leaders just got arrested, in Madrid and Mexico City. It's called IM Academy. There's a lot of news coming out about it now. Search 'im academy el pais' for an excellent article on it.

We're talking tomorrow. Might even be able to patch things up. She absolutely must be through with this shit though, which I think she finally is.

FINAL UPDATE:

She said she saw a number of red flag around the same time someone in her group mentioned the arrests. Manipulation of trading results. Their need for pages of instructions of how to get around firewalls, because their site is blocked so often. Tons of emotional, team building hype. So, she's not the sucker type, it was the only con she got involved in, she's out of it for sure, and we're back together!

I did not send the ring back, and I fully plan on proposing to her next weekend :)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here's how all that started:

I have a complex situation with my girlfriend where I fear she may have been taken in by a scam artist giving her a course on binary investments. Personally I believe technical analysis is almost always BS especially when applied to day trading, but she can suit herself, if she wants to learn about all the maths and strategies, go for it. But I'm concerned it's worse than that.

She began taking a couple of lessons during the day, but it's ballooned into late night group chats and all day course sessions. They talk about harmonics and all the latest buzzwords, and are super social and chatty. I just am very concerned where it all could be headed.

She has no money to spend, and so far only mentioned using a silo of $200 (a lot of money for her, she's in Mexico). I don't know if she's spent more. She doesn't want to hear my worries and doesn't talk about it. But if she's broke what's the worst that can happen? She has no job and lives off of her mother's pension. 

So, I'm trying to let her live her financial life and concentrate on what affects me, which I have to admit it does. Last night she abruptly paused a movie we'd been watching for a video chat &amp; coaching session ...and was on her computer with them for 2 hours straight! We got to bed at 10. She was up the next morning at 5 for more of her courses. I told her please just have me over when you can set aside time for us. But her courses just seem be getting more and more intense and time-consuming.

So either she's a dedicated student who's learning a lot, or unwitting victim of some sort of pyramid-ish scheme. I would bet anything it's the latter. I just don't know how such an investment coaching scheme would work. I can barely understand much of her side of the phone conversations even, her Spanish is too fast during them for my ears. 

Sadly I've come to realize that the only two outcomes realistically would be her losing a substantial amount of money and realizing she's been screwed over, or my breaking up with her once it's become too much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/17bisyy/instagram_daytrading_gurucoach_obsession_leads_to/,NEGATIVE,0.9995427131652832

My girlfriend [22 F] is obsessed with Instagram and it's driving me [29 M] nuts,relationships,"She is obsessed with Instagram and blogging and looking like she has the perfect life. Everything we do together is starting to seem like it's just a photo op. I have an incredibly stressful job and crazy shit went down last week that left me feeling really crappy and she suggested going camping for the weekend just to get away from everything and relax. Sounded like a good idea but turned out the weekend was only about taking pics. Normally I'll indulge her and take a few pics for her but last weekend was over the top, she wanted pictures of everything, we couldn't walk 100 feet without her stopping to take more pictures and asking me to take some of her. She also kept taking pics of me and was asking me to flex and telling me not to drink so much beer because I won't look good in photos. When I'm camping I just want to get fucking drunk and eat smores and not have to feel guilty about it so that really ruined the mood. 


I was pretty pissed off after Friday so I invited my buddy and his girlfriend (her best friend) to join us for the rest of the weekend because I wanted my girlfriend to fuck off and it worked but her and her friend kept taking just as many pictures and dicked around on their phones the whole time. It really bugs me. It seems like lately she won't do anything unless it can be hashtagged with pnwlife and even then she doesn't seem to enjoy doing those things, she only does it for the online version of her. 


I'm this close &gt; &lt; to throwing her phone out the window because it's driving me fucking crazy that she is always on it but I know that wouldn't solve anything. I don't want to lay down an ultimatum but I don't know what my other options are either. 


**tl;dr**: My girlfriends is always playing around on her phone and everything we do is only for the photo op

My (29M) girlfriend's (25F) Instagram obsession is (likely) destroying our relationship.,relationship_advice,"We met on Bumble in March and had the best date ever. We got to know each other quickly and realised we were uncannily similar people. Both into the same music, art, literature, introverted, etc. When lockdown began, she invited me to shack up with her and, despite the risk of this being a relationship death knell (as it has proven to be for some), it worked out well. Anyway, fast forward a few months and despite everything being peachy, her Instagram obsession exacerbated. Morning hugs were replaced with her scrolling for hours on end and if I brought it up with her, she'd snap. Then she'd apologise a little later for snapping and it'd be great again. But over time, her obsession with that godforsaken app has worsened dramatically. It isn't as though she's doing nothing with her life: she's about to embark on her PhD. Yet every God-given moment she's sat there endlessly scrolling. She'll spend entire days scrolling. She'll wake up at 5.30am each morning and scroll for two hours, before sleeping for another hour. Her tapping will wake me up. She'll scroll as we eat breakfast together, she'll scroll when I get back from work (I arrive home at around 10.30pm) as I'm talking to her about her day. I'd, without exaggeration, estimate that 70% of our conversations take place with a phone in-between us and her asking me to repeat myself multiple times. She even scrolls when we go out in dates and we're sitting in the restaurant. Weekend trips have been replaced with her lying on her bed, scrolling. Then she'll become extremely upset and aggressive with me if I ever ask her to put the phone down for a while. I adore her, because she's also the sweetest person I've ever met (when she's off her damn phone!). I think she's suffering from depression and I'd do anything to help her. But I'm reaching the point where I feel hopeless, abandoned and consequently, unhappy. I can't continue like this.  


Any advice or suggestions on how to deal with this?

My (F29) Boyfriend (M31) is obsessed with Instagram Girls,relationships_advice,"Hello Everyone!

I am in desperate need of advice and support. Currently I (F29) am in relationship of two year with my boyfriend (M31). Back in November 2022 I moved in with my boyfriend and we were so happy and in love. In January his iPhone broke and he needed a new one, so we went together to buy one and then he had to leave for work. While our relationship had been going very well up until this point, I had a random gut feeling that something was off and impulsively decided to go through his old cell phone. Upon looking through his phone I found evidence from many months leading up to us moving in that he had been talking to other girls, received nudes from a girl, kissed a girl at a concert, and was being set up to meet other girls through a mutual friend of ours. Of course when I saw all of this I was completely shocked and upset. I so badly wanted to end things then and there but since we had just moved in together I wanted to see if we could overcome this and make it work. After being confronted, he explained that he saw our relationship as very serious and these were thing she had done over the course of our relationship because he had never been in a relationship this serious and wanted to ""get this out of his system"". While I was doubtful of the validity of this excuse, I took him for his word and decided to move forward.

During this healing process he has been resistant but has ultimately complied with things I asked of him that would help me trust him again. However, after correctly guessing his Instagram password, I have been periodically logging in to see if he was betraying me again. While he has not messaged any girls or had any inappropriate conversations with friends, almost everyday in the morning he looks up 10-20 different girls (various thirst trap accounts, porn stars, and ex girlfriends/flings). My question for all of you is, should I accept that he is simply just looking at these girls without having an emotional relationship with them or should I realize I am being used and move on with my life?

Brutal honesty and advice is appreciated.

"1984-86 caught in between. Too young to get Xennial props, too old to be in the Instagram obsessed, stereotypical Millennials?",generationology,"I feel like 84-86 and even '87 borns like me are on the cusp of it. I've said that Millennials are the only generation that takes several years to ""get going"" where people seem like the media stereotype.

1981-'86 I feel are all early Millennials, but again don't typically fall into the social media obsessed types. My graduating class and the one after it, 1987-88 are the first to start having that as teens and definitely anyone even a little bit after us did.

**That's why I have such a grievance with Xennials ending in 1983, doesn't seem fair and it's far too early.**

Definitely 84-85 were partial 90s teens beyond just being little kids. But people don't seem to think they grew up with anything beyond Barney or the playground. Yet they're also too old for having even a texting phone in high school, much less social media. 1986 is on the cusp like I said, as at least the first dumbphones were getting popular in their senior year 03--04.

It's caught in between two worlds. That's why I like Xennials to be 1977-85 (yes its long for people's taste but its good to not exclude '77 who have been part of it for years, and they even used to be considered Y).

My obsession with Instagram stories is damaging my relationships,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,"Or well, friendships. 

Im not obsessed with instagram in the ""constantly comparing to others/posting selfies daily"" way. 

My problem is that I pay TOO much attention to instagram stories and my own as well. I will pierce together a whole story based solely on the stories of the people involved, I check who saw my stories and base my worth to them on that: If a friend doesnt watch my story, I assume they have blocked me for some slight or insult I was too dumb to notice, or they just got tired of me. I can get really upset and imagine all kinds of scenarios in which they wish me ill and hate me.

I know its silly, I know its not rational, and yet my brains goes from 0 to 100 making all kinds of crazy asumptions based on who posted what or saw what I posted.

I recently made up with a friend I kind of have a crush on and we hung out, he assured me he was over what had happened in the past and that I have his friendship even if hes a quiet introverted guy, he often forgets to reply or texts at random times. He also has not watched my stories recently despite posting his own, so of course I panicked. I didnt keep in contact with him and have not spoken to him since we met because Im scared he actually does dislike me/finds me obnoxious. My best friends have told that if anything refusing to talk to him is what makes me rude.

Rationally I know this isnt logical or healthy, I need go get better and I want to get better, but I need advice. Ive already placed rules for myself and my use of social media in general, I have an appointment with my therapist soon Ive talked to people I trust to help me, Im autistic and have depression, which I know ARE NOT excuses for my poor behavior but I take them into account bc I struggle with social norms and emotions.

I just need advice, I know Im inmature or dumb, so pls dont yell at me or tell me that people are right to dislike me.

What should i do about my Instagram obsession?,Advice,"I decided to post this on my throwaway account since i'm worried someone i know will see this.

I (20/F) have never been too big on social media, i got first phone in my 10th grade year of high school. I had only just got my first Instagram account my 11th grade year. As soon as I logged in it hit me and it felt amazing, i loved seeing new things and keeping up with my favorite creators, favorite friends and find girls on Instagram who i thought were absolutely beautiful, i didn't think much of it at the time following them as time went on I slowly started posting more and more each time I got on. It got more and more addictive.. i saw the increase on my likes and saw very kind comments. I would love posting and getting validation from people i never spoken to or heard of.. i had people following me that had large followings like over 100k. It all felt new to me and felt good. BUT as time went on months later i found it harder and harder to post, i found myself making sure i posted only stuff i knew my followers would like not stuff i liked, only stuff i knew would get me more and more followers/likes. I never got past 100 something followers because it got to the point where the people i once loved to look at who i thought were beautiful were suddenly now ugly to me purely out of jealousy. 

*''Why am i not like them?''*

*''Why can't i get likes like them?''*

*''Am i that ugly..?''*

*''If only i looked like her, then i'd be more loved.''* 

*''The boys would like me more if looked like her, spoke like her, had her body, or jaw line, etc''*

All of these are thoughts i'd have when on Instagram so i made the decision to get off Instagram since it got to the point i was crying at night and staying up wondering how i could change, what i could do to be JUST like these girls. I even blocked a lot of them before leaving out of jealously.  I never left mean comments though i only blocked them so i wouldn't have to see them. So i disable my account and never look back.. until midway into my 12th grade year my friend convinced me to get back on by giving me a motivational speech about how i shouldn't care. I being stupid agreed and said *''You're right!""* So onward i go back on Instagram but on a new account since i had been gone for so long i believe they deleted my account. So now here we are.. the present day. i've been using Instagram now for a long time now, i'm posting this because i'm currently back at square one. This time i'm completely additected to Instagram. I wake up get on, i spend half the day on it, and i always look at the same pretty girls i always saw before but now it's even MORE. I'm more insecure than i was before and now it's to the point where it's seeping into my real life and effecting my friendships. I still am obsessed with getting likes to the point where i rarely post in fear of not getting any and my friends seeing that. I'm also always talking about it and always whining about something i want that the other girls have. I don't do it on purse it just seeps out. Getting on now makes me feel like i'm old when i see girls who are like 15-19 having follower counts that only teenage me could've dreamed of, i feel old and lame because i feel like i'm out of place now when i post a selfie since when i posted selfies it wasn't as advance as it is now.  Hell i feel old compared to other 20 years olds on Instagram, everyone is just so beautiful and living their best lives and looking amazing while doing it and here i am on here whining and when i try and do the same it never turns out like i want it. I don't know how to fix my obnoxious obsession with likes, wanting followers and trying to look like other girls.  I can't see myself removing my Instagram again. I'd feel lost without it. I'm so annoyed with myself it's crazy. How can i fix this? does anyone have any advice on how i can move past this or how to force myself to delete Instagram? 

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Also if this has too many spelling errors i am very sorry about that, i'll fix it when i get the chance but right now i'm in a rush.

Edit: I tried to fix it as much as possible so it's a bit more readable. All tips and advice are welcomed. Thank you for reading.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bpmj77/what_should_i_do_about_my_instagram_obsession/,NEGATIVE,0.9987816214561462

So I’m in the legal field and have dabbled (work wise Obvs)  in legal issues with these accounts that target celebs and post about their kids to get the celebs to promote them. When a smart pepino noticed that the account had changed its name from different celeb children (I believe Shiloh Jolie Pitt), i thought of the same shit we’d see. Believe it or not Instagram is a hot spot for pedophiles to find links to other users that share child pornography. Like you wouldn’t believe how much of that is lead by Instagram, and the accounts that are involved are legit identical to the ones she promotes. And honestly whatever I understand she loves her kids and thinks they’re cute and maybe doesn’t see anything wrong in a random person being so obsessed with her children but she does need to be careful promoting those accounts :(.

"Hotel Offers ""Selfie Rooms"" for Guests Obsessed with Instagram",FunnyOrFakeNews,"A luxury hotel chain has come up with a unique way to cater to guests obsessed with social media – by offering ""selfie rooms"" that are specifically designed for the perfect Instagram shot.

According to hotel staff, the rooms come equipped with state-of-the-art lighting, strategically placed mirrors, and a selection of trendy backdrops that are sure to make any selfie look stunning. They've even hired a team of professional Instagrammers to provide guests with tips and tricks on how to take the perfect selfie.

However, the hotel has also issued a disclaimer, warning guests not to get too carried away with their selfie-taking. In a statement, they said, ""While we encourage our guests to take advantage of our selfie rooms, we also want to remind them that there's more to life than Instagram. Please enjoy your stay, but remember to take a break from your phone every once in a while.""

The hotel's ""selfie rooms"" have already become a hit with social media influencers and celebrities, with some even booking entire floors for their entourage.

In a tongue-in-cheek statement, a hotel spokesperson said, ""We're excited to offer this unique experience to our guests, but we also want to remind them that the real luxury of a hotel stay is disconnecting from the world and enjoying some much-needed rest and relaxation.""

This has been your breaking news update on the latest hotel trend – selfie rooms. Don't forget to take a break from your phone every once in a while, folks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/FunnyOrFakeNews/comments/11g2obt/hotel_offers_selfie_rooms_for_guests_obsessed/,NEGATIVE,0.7805439233779907

HELP! How to patch Instagram++ dependency paths!,sideloaded,"Hello people! I'm attempting to sideload Instagram with Instagram++, but I'm met with dependency issues.

Using sideloadly, I injected both the main tweak (InstagramPlus.dylib) and its required dependencies (libuasharedtools.dylib etc.) into an ipa file; upon installing this app onto an M1 Mac, the app was able to fetch all dependencies from within the application's directory, and the tweak was fully functional.

However, when installing this exact same payload onto iOS, the app crashes with the Exception ""EXC\_CRASH"", referencing the termination reason being `dependent dylib '/usr/lib/unlimapps_tweak_libs/libuasharedtools.dylib' not found for '/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/BundleIdentifier/Instagram.app/Frameworks/InstagramPlus.dylib'`. 

My understanding is that -  the tweak binary itself is requesting access to a dependency it has no rights to in the file system... Though under M1, the request was redirected to within the app's payload, which the tweak was able to fetch its dependencies from, in iOS, the tweak fetches directly from the file system it has no access to. (Since the device is not jailbroken)

In this case, I believe that patching some strings of the dependency within the tweak binary would fix the problem, but how would I specify the dependency location to be from within the application payload itself?",https://www.reddit.com/r/sideloaded/comments/wsn7y9/help_how_to_patch_instagram_dependency_paths/,NEGATIVE,0.9947078227996826

Instagram is ruining everything (a rant),unpopularopinion,"I think that Instagram is one of the worst developments in modern culture. Let me explain:

1. **IG is the most shallow of all social media platforms**. While social media platforms like twitter and sometimes even Facebook politically engage people, allow them to connect and organise Instagram is solely based on one person and their looks/life/vacation. No political or important dialogue is happening. I would argue that even Pinterest is more worthwile since at least DIYs teach you something.
2. **IG is all fake but everyone pretends that it's real.** Why we are all pretty much aware from our own Instagram use that these images are usually not what our lives look like all instagram users apparently have this pact that they are just all going to believe each other's bullshit.
3. **IG is bad for your mental health.** Because unrealistic standards are set on Instagram but everyone just pretends like they're real people doing real things it feels like everybody's life is the way it looks in IG. This also creates feelings of inadequacy and is therefore detrimental to especially young people's mental health. (See also this article: [http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/](http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/)). I also think this applies equally to women and men since the unrealistic standards concerning looks and lifestyle are more than ever directed towards both genders while they previously were more directed towards women as in e.g. advertising.  Additionally, the dopamine rush people get from likes creates an almost addiction-like potential that makes them use the app more and more and making the mental health issues even more pronounced.
4. **IG makes people vain.** Taking pictures of yourself all day makes you the center of your own attention and that leads to ignoring other people and the actual experience you're documenting. It's not about where you went what you ate or what incredible experience you had but only what it looked like and what you looked like doing it. This makes everybody focus more and more on their own appearance and less about things that actually make you a successful human being.
5. **IG gives the worst incentives to people.** The reason I am ranting right now is that I saw a Vice video about a poppy field in California that is killed by people sitting and stepping on it to take pictures predominantly for Instagram (Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxUrr-CIgkA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxUrr-CIgkA)). They then talked to the people taking the pictures asking them why they're doing it and their answers made me incredibly angry. Some people were open about just wanting likes but some others pretended like they were really concerned about the flowers talking about ""the feeling of being one with nature"". So these people want to signal to others that they love nature and the beauty of it while literally destroying the natural habitat and the flowers. This shows that they really don't care about anything at all except their likes on a goddamn picture. Now I don't think that they are inherently bad people but I think that Instagram actively gives them an incentive to be this way fuelled by the addictive potential of the platform and the likes you get from it.

I would encourage anyone reading this to please examine how much time you spend on Instagram and if you get anything from it than a simple dopamine rush and feelings of inadequacy and think of what you could do that's more meaningful and actually makes you happy.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: A lot of people are posting that they follow artists, architects, blacksmiths etc. and use Instagram predominantly in a small community or niche. So just to clarify, I do think that one can use Instagram positively and get a lot of good content from it. What I wanted to point out in my post is the culture that evolved around instagram and especially individual people posting nothing but their lives. And while some of you are so blessed as to not experience this culture in your everyday lives I feel like for others the posting ""cute"" pictures of oneself is a crucial part of social life e.g. kids in middle/high school. I do think that every social media platform can be great since it really depends on the users and what they post. However, I feel that while some good Instagram accounts exist the majority is selfies, vacation and food pictures and that this makes some people feel that they to share this much of their lives as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/bgsmm0/instagram_is_ruining_everything_a_rant/,NEGATIVE,0.9997833371162415

As a guy the current culture has made it incredibly easy to get a girlfriend,unpopularopinion,"It’s literally so easy, the standards have dropped because of how bad other dudes have been fucking up. Think about it: At this point women just want someone that isn’t 1.)A man child 2.)Clean 3.)In a somewhat decent shape (and not even all of them want that!). In college I heard so many horror stories about Nice Guys. If you can’t be better than thinking someone owes you a relationship because you had basic human decency, then you really shouldn’t be in a relationship anyway.

Have a job, have a personality and your own interest, have a goal, have a spine, and you’ll have an easy time. Also dating apps are trash just go talk to her.

Also, uninstall Instagram. A lot of guys I know struggling to find a relationship are the same dudes spending all their free time scroll through Photoshopped Instagram models and expecting all women to look like that. Dumb dumbs, those women’s entire livelihood depends on how they look. Are you putting in that same degree of effort into how you look? We both know the answer.

Edit: There is a grammatical error. Do be clean and be in shape (or not, dad bods are in.) Do be willing to acknowledge your mistakes.

Edit: A lot of you guys have defeatist minds sets, you’ll find any reason why you’re alone and perpetuate it in your every action and you won’t even know it. Yes if you are on the Spectrum this post does nothing for you, it will be more difficult for you. And I will concede, location does matter.

Instagram quality : Depends on both involved devices ?,GalaxyS7," Hi everyone !

For weeks, I've been trying to solve quality issues on instagram. I've tried lots of things : different export parameters (1080px max., quality to 75, file &lt; 500ko, etc.) but :

\- On my samsung S7 (same for xperia XA and for huawei p20 lite (less blurred on this last one however)) : On the profile, my pictures have a low quality. But on the same devices the quality of iOS user profile is perfect...

\- On a Huawei p20 pro however, everything looks fine, even my profile. And if I use [instagram.com](https://instagram.com/) on my PC with the toggle device on a navigator (phone view on PC), everything looks good.

I've tried to post from the computer, using this ""phone view"" tool, and same thing: with the three first devices, photos are seen blurred, and with the p20 pro, all is good. From another PC, this is also OK for the S7, but not others.

The only ""solution"" I found to get a sharp picture on all devices, is to crop my picture to 1:1 ratio directly in the IG app. Proof that my phone can be used for good quality profile...

So, does anyone know what could be the problem ? Can I do something, or it totally depends on instagram ?

I'm almost thinking of buying an old iphone only to post... (but please help me avoid that ahah). Yeah, I'm quite obsessed with quality. \^\^

Thanks for your help, and good luck to everyone for the quarantine !",https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS7/comments/fqrx9p/instagram_quality_depends_on_both_involved_devices/,NEGATIVE,0.9952148199081421

But on my good days too, I miss it sometimes and feel like downloading it just for a few but I realise that this dependency is NOT cool. 

Although my Instagram usage was never more than 20 minutes on an average, i did notice that on days where my mind was fucked up it would go as high as 1.5 hours.

Massage therapist recording session without consent + posting to social media,massage,"I follow my massage therapist on Instagram and saw that she posted a video of herself massaging me. Nothing scandalous was posted --  my nude back and butt crack show slightly -- but I worry about what other footage she might have. She has \*never\* mentioned that she is recording the sessions and I am 99.9% sure I never consented to any form of recording (I'm pretty sure she hasn't had me sign any paperwork besides her cancellation policy on MassageBook, and I generally read anything I sign).

I'm in the US, in North Carolina. Is she legally allowed to record me without my consent? The angle of the camera would have pointed straight at me fully nude disrobing before the session and getting dressed again after the session.

What is my best course of action here?

"I’m Rochelle Garza. I’ve gone toe to toe with Trump, Kavanaugh and corrupt AG Ken Paxton on reproductive rights — and won. Now, I’m running to be the first woman and Latina Texas Attorney General to fight for working families and defend Texans’ constitutional rights. AMA!",politics,"I’m Rochelle Mercedes Garza. I’m a civil rights attorney and a 5th generation Texan from the Rio Grande Valley. I’m running for Texas Attorney General to fight for Texas working families because we deserve to have a people’s attorney who will protect our civil rights, health and safety.

My drive to fight for Texas families comes from my own working family. I’m the daughter of two public school teachers who taught me to work hard and that everyone deserves dignity and respect. These are the values I saw at home.

My oldest brother, Robby, experienced a brain injury during childbirth and grew up with disabilities. I saw how hard my parents fought for him, just like so many Texas families. I learned that our family’s health depended on all of us being okay.

That’s why I’ve focused my legal career on fighting for people that have been counted out, overlooked and left behind - because the health of our communities depends on every member being okay.

I've practiced immigration, family, criminal defense and civil rights law.I know what it’s like to fight for individuals in Texas courts and how to build a case that reinforces reproductive rights across the country. My work has had broad impacts, like the “Garza Notice,” a requirement that teens in immigration detention have a right to access abortion care, and also meaningful individual impacts, like helping Trans clients acquire name and gender marker changes on their documentation to affirm who they are.

As an expecting mother, I want to ensure that my daughter grows up with the freedom to determine her own course in life, to marry who she loves, to decide if, when or how to become a parent, and to grow up in a clean, safe environment. I’m ready to take on our corrupt and indicted AG Ken Paxton and roll back the harm he’s done to our families.

As Attorney General, I’ll fight like hell for Texas families, for all of us.

People who measure others success by what car they drive are insecure and incredibly fragile.,unpopularopinion,"People who’s car is their personality, or who try and put down others by using their car type against them are totally deluded and incredibly insecure and fragile. Usually theyre the ones flashing cash on instagram, or dependent on their partner for any money they have. They cant even fathom the idea that a lot of people dont see a car as some incredible investment, rather than a way of getting from A to B if they need to. Or that some people dont own a car out of choice, not financial hardship.

But IMO this team is too ISO dependant to truly be *the* greatest possible. The easy task would be too replace just 1 or 2 players with others, but I propose a more difficult endeavour - build a team to beat them, without *any* players from Shaq's team.

Dragula Titans Post-Disappearance Lisbeth Salandering Thread #1,Dragula,"# Updated 17/7

Hey everyone, we're pretty sure Titans (or whatever they choose to call it, but we're going with Titans for now) has begun filming, or at least the mosters have disappeared. Believe the sequester date was the 9th of July, but as you'll see that's not a hard, absolute rule. Hope you enjoy the cast, also hope this is actually all right because I'd hate to get people's hopes up!

Is $META going to benefit from Threads?,stocks,"One of the questions that many META shareholders have is, what is the impact of Threads on the company’s value?

The answer isn’t simple, and I’ll try to break down the components and share my thoughts.

Mark Zuckerberg shared that monetization options would be explored once Threads hits one billion users (As am I writing this, there are over 83 million users. For comparison, Twitter has close to 400 million).  
  
From Meta’s point of view, the so-called family of Apps includes two social media platforms - Facebook and Instagram. Both of these platforms are in mature monetization stages, where both the revenue per user and the margins are incredibly high.  
  
If we take a look at the big picture, all social media companies make money by selling advertisements. The formula behind that is simple:

**Number of users** X **Time spent on the platform** X **Advertisement revenue**

The time that is being spent is limited, every one of us has 24 hours in a day and decides how to use (or waste) it.  
  
Part of the Facebook/Instagram users will use part of their time using Threads and the impact is obvious. If we take a look at the formula above, it is quite clear that the time spent on Facebook/Instagram will be lower, hence, the revenue generated there is expected to decrease. In addition, as Threads is not monetized, it will only bring additional expenses for keeping the platform up and running. In the short run, there shouldn’t be high expectations for Meta when it comes to the financials.

Whether Threads will generate value, in the long run, depends on a few factors:

\- The # of users that join Threads, from Twitter.

\- The monetization per user of Threads, and how far it will be compared to Facebook/Instagram (So far, Twitter didn’t use its potential)

\- The outcome of the cease-and-desist letter sent to Meta by Spiro (Elon’s lawyer) for creating a “copycat” app.

&amp;#x200B;

Meta's value will increase, only if:  
  
\- The total number of users (Facebook/Instagram/Threads) increases at the expense of Twitter, and;

\- The revenue generated is higher and can cover the additional expenses for running Threads.  
  
I personally, do not think the new platform is creating a lot of value for Meta.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14ua1ys/is_meta_going_to_benefit_from_threads/,NEGATIVE,0.9769360423088074

Baby girls steal their mothers beauty...,NotHowGirlsWork,"I came across this randomly on Instagram and couldn't believe it. Theres so many excuses women have for not wanting girls, a lot of them based in sexism and misogyny, but this was a new one for me! 

There were also comments stating the opposite was true in terms of how the mothers changed or felt during pregnancy with a boy or girl. It all depends. Some try to explain its hormones, which is true to an extent, but not because of the sex of the child. It depends entirely on the mother and her own health. Heres one article I found explaining it 
https://theconversation.com/are-maternal-hormones-different-when-carrying-a-boy-or-a-girl-78348

I personally hate when people pretend to have knowledge on something they dont just to push an agenda but its clear sex is not a major factor in how a pregnancy turns out. Some of those stories can be cute like how the belly sits, or if you get hairy, or how the coin swings over a belly (thats a tradition in my culture) but ones pushing sexism and hatred towards the baby is horrible. 

I know a woman in my family who is so misogynistic that when I heard she was having a baby boy I was relieved. Unfortunately shes a ""boy mom"" now whose in some emotional dependent relationship with her son. Shes controlling and possessive and doesnt allow him his own space or voice. That being said, if she had a girl instead Im sure she would be in constant competition with her, shaming her, instilling insecurities into her. Some parents dont deserve their children for so many reasons, but sexism is a huge one. 

I saw some other comment saying its meant to be a positive thing, like youre gifting your daughter your beauty but it still lies in sexism and the obsession with how girls look. Many girls get shamed by their mothers on how they look no matter what. Its sad. Just look at some of the reactions in the comments. The mothers visibly angry and resentful of their daughters and even swearing off pregnancy because of it. 

Also the person who made the video was just talking about how drastically her face and body changed. And those were the comments. Turns out she had a boy. 

Also I thought the ""allergic to the babys daddy"" joke was funny xD some lightheartedness in a sea of stupid comments.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17p9vn7,POSITIVE,0.9940804839134216

At my job I deal with a lot of uber-wealthy men. Their wives fall into two categories...,redscarepod,"A.  Chubby and sweet (sometimes sassy), their first loves who saw their men through the economic rise.


B.  The trophy wife about half their age.

The latter is always visually a bit ludicrous - a young hot Instagram model type chick with an older guy striving to look younger than he is.  The nature of their arrangement is so blatant.  All are generally nice and pleasant people to deal with though.  After all, why would you be grumpy when you are loaded?

It always makes me sad when dealing with the trophy wives.  So much of their self-worth is dependent on their looks which will slowly abandon them over time.  Their interactions with their husband always seem pretty surface level -   the husbands often treat them like children.

It's hard to blame them for choosing that path though.  You wouldn't believe the size of their closets!",https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/14kdqjb/at_my_job_i_deal_with_a_lot_of_uberwealthy_men/,POSITIVE,0.8328225016593933

AITA for telling my wife to stop excessively posting pictures of her belly to Instagram,AmItheAsshole,"My wife (F 34) is currently pregnant and basically she's been really ""marketing"" it on her Instagram, almost every story she has or post involves showing off a photo of her belly and I'm really fed up with it.

I've had to work a lot more, some weeks I'm not home for a good chunk of the week, I used to feel pretty happy checking her instagram stories, what she's up to?, what's she doing with our girls?, etc. However, it's just boring and the same. Even her friends are starting to get fed up with it, she recently posted a picture that was just her smiling and one of her friends commented ""You look lovely, glad it's not another belly pic"".

I decided to talk to her about it and told her I would really prefer to tones down posting photos of her belly, everyone knows she's pregnant and I would really prefer if she would go back to what she did before on Instagram. We got into an argument, her saying it's her personal Instagram, ""don't watch if you don't like it"", ""I don't understand what it feels like"" etc  etc. Now she's kinda in a little huff and not really communicating with me.

I can understand she's very excited and happy being pregnant and is pretty bored being out of work, however I really felt I needed to tell her to tone it down, I don't her posting out child's face all over social media either.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11crgwj/aita_for_telling_my_wife_to_stop_excessively/,NEGATIVE,0.9759104251861572

"Did I use ""excessive"" force in defending myself?",LegalAdviceUK,"Hi all,  
  
A while back I was assaulted by a woman in an unprovoked attack, I took two blows before I retaliated with a single punch, hospitalizing her. I've recently found the police have only just started investigating, and is it's been well over 28 days they have stated there is no realistic chance of obtaining CCTV, which would have shown her running up to me and assaulting me. I'm now concerned I may be charged with using excess force, being a man and considerably larger than she.  
  
I did not suffer any visible damage and have just a single favourable witness. Thankfully though it was after Midnight I hadn't been drinking, I had no time to think, plus I wear glasses and feared she was targeting my eyes, which if she'd smashed the lenses could have blinded me.

Excessive name use to avoid pronouns?,NonBinary,"So how do we feel about people doing this? My boss at my new job has in multiple emails used my name repeatedly - like, I'm talking once or twice in every. single. sentence. - in a way that feels like he's trying to avoid having to use my pronouns (they/them). 

Like one of these emails I counted and he used my name NINE TIMES in 2 paragraphs and used ""they"" to refer to me exactly ONCE. 

And I'm trying to figure out if I'm being oversensitive here, but it really feels kinda...idk, just kind of weird and icky. 

If I were feeling particularly uncharitable, I might even say it feels like he's refusing to use the correct pronouns, and using my name as a workaround so that he's not actively and overtly misgendering me by using the wrong pronouns and can't get in trouble for that, but he doesn't have to use they/them either. 

Like it's def less worse than being she'd at (which my last job was awful about doing) and in the grand scheme of things is pretty minor, so I'm wondering how other people would feel about this and if I'm just being oversensitive or something?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/16usgf9/excessive_name_use_to_avoid_pronouns/,NEGATIVE,0.9991683959960938

AITA for using excessive profanity in my yard?,AmItheAsshole,"We have a pool. I have an agreement with my neighbor that any time neither my wife nor I am currently in the pool, she's more than welcome to use it with her kids. If we're using it, just wait until we're done and come on over.  

I also have an incredibly unruly Rose Of Sharon bush in my yard. Yesterday was devoted to me fighting that bush. So, I'm out there clipping, chopping, and at one point even using my sawzall to take this monster down a notch.  

While I'm doing this, Debbie (not her real name) and her kids are swimming in my pool, and using my grill to make themselves lunch, which is perfectly fine. 

So, I've got my headphones on. Music helps me focus. Sometimes I sing along if I'm really in the groove. 

Anyway, Dirtbike by Zheanni comes on. I'm singing along. For anyone unfamiliar, this song has a lot of ""fucks"" in it, along with ""cunt"" and ""donkey dick"". 

I'm a good 60' from the pool though, so I think nothing of it, and just sing along. 

Later on last night, I get a FB notification that I'm tagged in a post from Debbie. She was complaining that ""people"" (clearly me) shouldn't act like their house is a kid friendly environment, if they're going to be using vulgar language in front of children. 


On the one had, I feel like I'm not the asshole here, since it was my own yard, and I genuinely didn't think the kids would even hear me. 

But on the other hand, I knew they were in my yard, and I could have easily just not sang out loud, so I feel like an asshole a bit. 

Edit to update: 

Ok, so I'm on my lunch now. I went over to talk to her on my way to work this morning, and she threw dog poop at me! I'm going to be locking the gate for a while until I figure out what the heck is going on. This isn't like her at all, she's lived next to me for a long time, and this is just so out of character.

Giving residents feedback about excessive social media use during shift,medicine,"Hello everyone. I’m a psych attending in an academic system. I have had an issue recently with a few residents time management. I usually cover overnight shifts in the hospital since I don’t really like just having to answer my pager every hour at home. A lot of the residents recently have had issues getting H&amp;Ps done in a timely manner. Overnight, I definitely don’t hold them to the same standard that I would during the day for note writing, organization, and detail, but there are a lot of times the H&amp;Ps are so far from being done they have to stay hours late while the day team is still there to get them done for me to attest. My biggest frustration with this is that when I’ve approached them in the past about how I can help them improve efficiency, they said they feel like they’re overworked. From a macro scale, I totally understand that. But from a “during the shift” perspective, I can’t get on board. I constantly see them on their phones/computers doing nonwork things (social media, online shopping, etc). I understand taking mental breaks during work, but it’s a lot of personal activity while at work, not just here and there. I’m seeing them on Reddit and Facebook for 2+ hours during an overnight shift - and not just when there’s no work to be done and it’s slow. I’ve brought this up to them as well and haven’t seen much long lasting behavior change as the next shift I’m on with them, same thing happens. It’s multiple residents so it’s not just an isolated issue. 

I’ve brought it up in real time and also reiterate it at the end of the shift that they should not be spending so much time on personal things as it is impacting patient care. Maybe I am too soft and should be more assertive? Thanks in advance for your help.

Juicy J Says Three 6 Mafia Broke Up Due To Excessive Drug Use,hiphopheads," ""Hip Hop fans are preparing themselves for what is expected to be yet another monumental moment on Verzuz. After over a year of delays, cancellations, and false promises, we'll finally see Three 6 Mafia and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony join together on stage. As usual, Verzuz is a place for celebrating our icons and taking a stroll down the memory lane of their catalogs, but fans are still weighing in about which group they believe will take the battle crown.  


Ahead of Three 6 Mafia's appearance, Juicy J caught up with Nas and Miss Info on their podcast The Bridge: 50 Years of Hip Hop where he spoke about the Memphis group's rise and eventual tumble. According to the Oscar winner, drugs played a significant role in their retreat from the spotlight.  


“From heroin to meth to cocaine, all kinds of pills,” J said of the group's breakup. “A lot of drugs were consumed during the times we were together. When everybody was sober and sh\*t, everybody’s on the same page But when cocaine’s involved, things change. But I’m not pointing a figure at nobody.”  


He reportedly added that he couldn't think of any other reason why Three 6 Mafia struggled through that period. “People wasn’t showing up in the studio,"" he said. ""Business was crazy, everything’s folding... it was the drugs.” Make sure to tune into Verzuz on Thursday, December 2 at 6:30 p.m. PT/9:30 p.m. ET.

How to report excessive use of force by the police,Denver,"For anyone concerned about the excessive use of violence by the Denver Police last night, it may be useful to start an information thread for local oversight agencies to contact. 

Denver has an Office of the Independent Monitor, which is a civilian oversight agency for the city and county of Denver. All their contact info is [here](https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/office-of-the-independent-monitor.html). You can report verbally and send in pictures or videos of violence against peaceful protestors. You can also link them to videos you didn’t take (I linked them to the one of the cop lobbing a tear gas canister into the peaceful crowds). 

The Denver city council also has the right to investigate city agencies. The main contact link is [here](https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/denver-city-council/contact.html), but you may contact each council person individually as well.

I haven’t had any luck contacting the mayor, but if you would like to give it a try the information is [here](https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/mayors-office/contact-the-mayor.html). 

Finally, no idea where Jared Polis stands on this, but it may be worth contacting him too. [Here](https://colorado.gov/governor/contact-us) is the link for how to do that. 

Obviously some people may disagree about what constitutes excessive use of force- so you may as well send in all the evidence you have and see what comes of it.

AITA For removing a housemates frozen leftovers from the freezer due to excessive use of space.,AmItheAsshole,"So at university in our halls of residence we have 6 rooms with en-suites and then a kitchen which is shared by all 6 of the rooms. In the kitchen we have one fridge and two freezers. There is 3 draws/shelves in each of the freezers and we’ve adopted a loose ‘one freezer drawer each’ policy. We don’t stick to it religiously it’s just a within reason type of thing. 

So I moved quite far from university because I wanted to be away from home. None of my secondary school friends or friends from home came with me. One of my dorm mates is the exact opposite, it seems that everyone she knows came to this university and she’s not made much effort to be social with our dorm since she’s got her own friends already including her boyfriend - not a problem. 

So flash to the incident. I come home from a trip to the supermarket and bring back a bunch of frozen stuff with me, nothing that would take up more than a shelf. When I go to the freezer I normally use there is a huge Tupperware container on the shelf I normally use with one portion of left over chilli in it. Now this Tupperware box could have easily fit 12 portions of chilli in it, but there was only one portion in there. 

I checked the other freezers and the other shelves to make sure there was no space and then I knocked on her door to see if she was in but I got no answer. Now I had about $30 worth of frozen stuff to put away as I only shopped for frozen stuff fortnightly so I could get a taxi back instead of waiting for a bus. So the only logical thing was to remove the obscenely large Tupperware box, which I did. 

I put it on the shelf with some of my smaller boxes and left a note, since she’d not given any of us a phone number, saying. ‘If you need smaller boxes let me know, happy to lend if you need. If it spoils let me know.’ Then I put my stuff away and left it at that. 

The next day someone knocks on my door and it’s her boyfriend. He says something along the lines of. ‘Don’t touch my girlfriends food’ and tries to give off an intimidating aura. I essentially cut to the chase and tell him that if there is a problem she needs to come speak to me, and that she needs to not take obnoxious amounts of valuable space and then politely tell him to get fucked. 

She hasn’t spoken to me about it again.

CSGO helped me stop using heroin and focus my excess energy.,GlobalOffensive,"For my entire life I always did just about every single thing in my life addictively. I always used to try and focus my energy into extreme sports and the like when I was younger. I always used to skateboard, bmx, and yes, even rollerblade for some time. However that lifestyle lended itself heavily to the stoner lifestyle. Alas, my drug of choice quickly changed from weed to painkillers and then I eventually jumped to heroin.

I got clean in 2013 and was into COD Black Ops 2 but that game sucks and I would constantly get made and smash my controller. It just wasn't streamlined enough, idk. CSGO was able to teach me patience, strategy, and teamwork. It has focused my energy when I am alone in a way that nothing else has ever been able to do.

This is a short and sweet post but just wanted to say Thank You CSGO!

Edit: Thanks for shiny gold I never got this what do I do?

Edit2: Thanks for all the support again guys! If you are struggling with addiction, just know that there's a whole world on the other side just waiting for you. Also, for those saying I replaced one addiction with another, LOL. Go stick a needle in yr arm and let me know if you thing playing CSGO is the same.

I hate the excessive use of the word 'Like' in the context of describing a feeling or action in conversational speech.,unpopularopinion,"This is something typical to be overheard in a conversation on a subway, in a pub, bar, park and is especially prevalent with the younger people and I hate how it clutters the language and reduces the eloquence of dialogue. 

Example:

'... and like he was Like angry and then like I was Like confrontational about it and then like she got like sad thereafter and like then I got like  hungry after all that' 

What really should be said:

'... and he was angry and then I was confrontational about it and then she got sad thereafter and then I got hungry after all that' 

You either are feeling the emotion or aren't; you either are doing something or aren't doing it;

Or you can use words ie 'a little bit', 'sort of', 'very' to reduce/increase significance of the particular action/emotion if you prefer. 

'... and he was proper angry and then I was confrontational about it and then she got a little sad thereafter and then i got really hungry after all that'

the worst thing is that this is very common. A Lot of people converse using 'like' instead of taking a small pause to breathe, form their sentences in their heads and then speak their thoughts.
